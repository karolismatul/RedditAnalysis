"We've shared finances since the beginning. Not a joint account but we juat transfer as needed from one account to the other depending on who's making more at the time. More or less once a year I track all our spendings for a few months to make sure we're still in check and not spending more than we should. We always consult each other before buying anything over $250ish.

After reading the surrendered wife these past three days I do think it would be good if my husband would be in charge of the finances. He is the one who makes the most money and the one who initiates the biggest purchases like holidays, speaker systems etc. He always has to ask me if he thinks we should do it, and often we don't, or wait or find a cheaper option etc. It's not that great to have to tell him no. At the same time I can be too tight with money and we'd probably enjoy ourselves more if he was in charge. The irony here is that sometimes when I'll update him of our spendings vs income and how much we have left each month after all regular expenses and stuff he thinks it's too little and that we should have a bigger margin, but then doesn't want to look at it more or talk about it because it makes him stressed. (His family has gone bankrupt and he's from a poor neighbourhood so he's very stressed about not having enough, yet he hates penny pinching, something that I am a big fan of, and it's so weird to me.) If he was in charge of it he would maybe automatically take the necessary steps to make that margin bigger, and put money aside for holidays or other bigger purchases so he could buy it without having to discuss it too much with me first. He would KNOW when we had enough to go on a spontaneous trip instead of getting sad and feeling like I don't want to do fun stuff when I just start talking about money when he talks about doing something fun... 

I didn't think it would be possible to get him to consider being in charge of our finances (because he always, always insisted I'd do it. After we moved to my homecountry it took a couple of years before he even logged into his own bank account!!) I was going to make a separate post about it (before I saw this one) but today something strange happened. 

This is the last year we can go on holiday outside of public holidays because our oldest son will start school, so he brought it up, and asked where we should go this spring. I took the opportunity and mentioned it will be easier to know after we track our spendings for a couple of months (which we already agreed on) as our financial situation has changed a lot the past couple of years. He agreed. I said that actually, even though I know he wants me to do it it might be better if he did because then he wouldn't have to consult me all the time, he could just make the decision because he'd be on top of the financial situation. And he actually nodded and agreed and threw in that he'd be much better at making cool graphs than me. I confirmed and said that he'll probably do a better job overall. He agreed.

I am flabberghasted. I mean, there's a long way from that casual conversation to it actually happening. He's not the greatest at following up on things (there's f.ex. a mirror on the floor in the hallway, leaning against the wall that should have been hung on the wall about 1 year ago.) But it seemed like he responds well to me showing that as long as he has an overview of our finances I trust he'll make good decisions for our family and the thought of being able to plan without me ""standing in the way"". 

I'm hopeful that he can take charge of this and will keep ""surrendering"" in general and see how it develops. I'll try my best to not tell him to do it the way I've been doing it, but let him find his own system. (Which is another frustration, because when I ask him to bring me receipts of everything he's spending (cash) or ask him about certain things on his bank statements to know which categories to put it in he's not the greatest. He doesn't like having to keep track of it etc (part of the reason we only track a couple of months a year. It's always very stressfull since he doesn't want to have to keep track and report to me. He never likes my systems but never comes with his own ideas either. (It's the same with where to keep his stuff etc. He says he can't tidy cause he doesn't have a place to put his things. I tell him to just choose a drawer or decide on some other solution and just decide, but he doesn't! He thinks everything in the house is ""mine"" and there's no space for ""his"" things. Maybe that will change too now...)

No stats are bad. You said having high composure is bad. So you're actually missing information about the game because you dont know how this stat works. Like I said, I already know where you got all your info from and while some of it was correct, the people testing it did not control for shit very well. A lot of the data is off or straight up not useful in an actual game setting where 15 things are in play at once.

Anyway I already answered you: they dont reveal stuff to make the game organic. You can learn more about what the stats do by playing the characters that utilize them. Of course you will never know the good things about composure if you only play Chad and Buggzy all day. Those who say Jenny is bad just reveal they have no hours invested in her.

"I'm a lefty too, and my Metro with a fine nib works great most of the time. I don't have many medium nib pens and I only have a 1.1 stub Lamy that I use to write in headers in my planner and stuff. Most of my inks are pretty forgiving in the fine nib. My only exception seems to be Noodler's Black, which feels like it takes forever and a week to dry sometimes.  
My solution to smearing is to first write slower -- I know I tend to write too fast and being a slight overwriter, that means I'll drag my hand over the preceding line and smear things if I go too quickly.  
My second solution is to use something to serve as a blotter and keep it under your hand as you work down the paper. I find that watercolor paper (the rough texture one, not the one that looks like waxed paper) works well.

"First off, understand this is a legitimate question. The reason people downvote it and shit on you is because this subreddit has a lot of purists that maybe don't run a business, or understand the relationship that Martial Arts has with our modern world. People here are special sometimes.

Distance learning is hard to capitalize on because at the end of the day, you're relying on a few things:

* Someone is going to pay you for those services. 

* People won't copy, reproduce and redistribute your content. 

* You'll be able to provide quality instruction that differs from hands on instruction. 

Monetizing is hard, especially because you're not just competing locally with another club; but with a global market. You're competing with Martial Artists who produce videos for free, for fun. And others who might be famous trainers. 

The best thing you can do is create a type of ""Cardio Kickboxing"" program that you can trademark and sell as a program to clubs and fitness centres/trainers who are looking for buy-in options. This is preferable to just distance training for a few reasons.

You'll be able to control your content and image. You make a fun logo, some t-shirts, literature and DVD's or a private web portal that those people who buy in can access and get schedules, training lists, etc. from. You capitalize further on this by making those trainers your customers. You release news, offer deals through your suppliers (For pads, etc.) offer dietary plans, personal training tips and what not.All that happens as a result of them buying into the program, it's not a freebie you offer to anyone. 

The idea is that you're providing a service that is flexible for their fitness centre/training centre that allows them to not invest their time heavily into the program, but rather just open up your program and throw it right into active use. Do a yearly membership. If they don't buy in after the first year, they lose access to that web portal, they no longer get supplied with t-shirts, banners, etc. And essentially have to either re-brand or re-create a program. But they won't be able to use your DVD's or content because it'll all be branded towards you. 

The big cost centre for this really lays in your web hosting, business overhead, branding costs and video production costs. You don't want to cheap out, otherwise you're not gonna have any buyers. The big thing is its always a risk, because you can't sell the program unless you have content. You need to make that initial investment first, then hope your marketing and everything else falls into place.

"Having read through this thread, it seems maybe you have an objection to sacred spaces and varied formal practices?

A ""sacred space"" is a space set aside for certain practices. You can work out at home lifting soup cans, but many people go to gyms to work out anyway. What we do is sometimes called Buddhist ""practice"" for a reason.

In my experience, practice in sacred space, whatever it is, using whatever it is that helps, builds a certain ability. Without such practice done regularly, I would have found it difficult to find peace sitting in a chair at a hospital when family members were sick or dieing. As it is, doing just that was possible for me. Rather like, because someone works out regularly at their gym with specialized equipment, they might someday find it possible to carry themselves or themselves and a loved one out of a ditch to find help in a crisis.

That's the real use of sacred space, or even ritual and liturgy. It's just specialized equipment. Some people get caught up in pumping iron and it becomes a thing of its own, sure. But that doesn't mean it isn't useful.",yukontodd,1512432013,Buddhism

"I can see the depression.   And hey, if the idea of that debt was affecting your mental well being enough to depress you, and paying it off got rid of the depression, then you made the rigjt decision.  Not everyone can do math and live their life based on the results.  

But in general, without the mental health problems, IBR is almost made for people in your situation.  If you are never going to earn enough to be able to pay it off, you never have to.  Yeah, you have a monthly payment for 20 or 25 years, but it is never more than a percentage of your disposable income...if you never rise out of poverty, you don't pay at all.

You could have kept the insurance payout and used a small piece of it to cover taxes on the forgiven amount.  So if you had invested the inheritance, and your loans doubled again, you would probably only have to pay out 20 to 40 percent of your investment by the end. 

I mean, my wife and I were considering divorce just based on the numbers...If she couldn't find work, and we would have had to put her on IBR to avoid paying her loans.  Which meant we had to file taxes as married filing separately, with all the penalties that entailed, to keep my income from counting toward her loans.  It quickly made more sense to divorce and keep her as a mistress instead.  And I was ready to do that, when she found work.

"&gt;Objectively wrong.

Regarding trade. Not military alliances, m8. No one is talking about invading Britain. Especially, not the article OP linked.

&gt;he even cosied up to the leader of Britain's most important ally? I didn't read anything similar when Macron hosted Trump in Paris, gosh it's almost like people have double standards. As for the 'rebuff' - the UK should always be willing to speak up if an American president is wrong, and retweeting Britain First was wrong. 

Again, regarding trade. The point of the article. Trump promised a fast track free trade agreement. It's no where in sight, and the people of the UK don't want gammy fucking chicken. Then May went to India, proposing a free trade deal. But again, she lives in a fantasy, that because the UK was their colonial master, they'd give them a preferential deal. She was sent back with a demand for more visas for Indian citizens. Given the Brexiteers got a huge bump from the anti-immigrant wave, I'm not sure that's what they thought they were voting for.

&gt;And it's not about needing to remind people about how 'important' Britain is. I can address a ridiculous Guardian article if I so desire.

Yeah, but stay on point. It's about trade, the relation with the EU and influence. The May government has pissed away any good will they had.

So you are wrong, objectively. The UK has never succeeded when it's been protectionist (nor has Ireland), and won't this time. The Brexiteer's are going against the entire trend in world politics: interdependence, and shared sovereignty.

2) there’s a single piece of denim that’s ~30 something inches long under tension in the waist. There’s two ~12 inch pieces with stitching between in the thighs. It’s easier to stretch that one long piece than the two short pieces 

3) someone usually mentions that your waist is bony and the bone can’t compress like your thighs",nfitzsim,1512432015,rawdenim

"**Correlation does not imply causation**

In statistics, many statistical tests calculate correlations between variables and when two variables are found to be correlated, it is tempting to assume that this shows that one variable causes the other. That ""correlation proves causation,"" is considered a questionable cause logical fallacy when two events occurring together are taken to have established a cause-and-effect relationship. This fallacy is also known as cum hoc ergo propter hoc, Latin for ""with this, therefore because of this,"" and ""false cause."" A similar fallacy, that an event that followed another was necessarily a consequence of the first event, is the post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin for ""after this, therefore because of this."") fallacy.

For example, in a widely studied case, numerous epidemiological studies showed that women taking combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) also had a lower-than-average incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), leading doctors to propose that HRT was protective against CHD. But randomized controlled trials showed that HRT caused a small but statistically significant increase in risk of CHD. Re-analysis of the data from the epidemiological studies showed that women undertaking HRT were more likely to be from higher socio-economic groups (ABC1), with better-than-average diet and exercise regimens.

"MPV (cross platform) or MPC (windows only) are both much better players than VLC, at least in my opinion.

They do a better job decoding/rendering video vs VLC, don't drop frames as often on lower end systems, don't suffer from a few catastrophic issues that VLC has.

Like how VLC on Windows with an Nvidia graphics card will always render video with limited dynamic range (16-235) instead of full (0-255) resulting in a washed out image. Note that if you have an Nvidia graphics card, it actually defaults your whole monitor to limited also, washing out your whole desktop. I really recommend changing this: https://i.imgur.com/pOUp4bm.jpg

"It's actually got very little to do with how the bottom  run are trained and more to do with officers. It's the same in business as in the military, I've found - you can't predict the quality of employees or soldiers (but you can drive them harder), but it's about making sure your managers aren't idiots. It just so happens that in war, there's less day to day and more knife-edge momentary encounters than in business, so it's very possible for an organization that looked strong and well trained to prove itself suddenly incompetence.

In the conventional strategy, 2003 Iraq was brilliant - a classic war of maneuver avoiding strongpoints. In the counter-insurgent strategy, it was deficient. They won one war and lost another.

Short encircling attacks are just conventional wisdom in war right now. They were extraordinarily popularized by the Germans who essentially made them mandatory between 1862 and 1914, when Moltke indoctrinated his general staff to seek them as high priority, and von Schlieffen published his multi-volume work, Cannae, which essentially held the encirclement to be the holy grail of modern warfare.

"One question though, my batteries are providing just the right amps for 1 motor, am I going to have to quadruple the power supply in parallel to power all 4 motors? Or will it just empty the battery 4 times as fast, despite it specifically stating it's 250ma.
All the books and documentation I've been reading just sort of ignore the amps side of things, probably to keep things simple. So I'm not too sure.

If this is the case, powering the bot using 16aa batteries and constantly managing their charge seems like a massive and tedious waste of effort. Do you have any suggestions for a way to supply 6-9v at 1A?

A few 18650 cells seem like a decent alternative due to the high voltage and amount of charge they can hold, but I am struggling to find what sort of amps they provide.

Edit:

Go to a coffee chain, a Dome, Jamaica Blue, Muffin Break, Miss Mauds, Mrs Fields, Michels or the like if you want to buy a kilo of fresh beans.

I know for at least 3 of the chains I listed above, they will sell you a kilo of sealed, unground beans. I have previously worked for 2 different Australia Wide chains, and when people have bought beans we sell them the same beans we would put in the hopper ourselves that day. 

If you want fresh I would avoid Gloria Jeans simply because their many different bean varieties wouldn't move as quickly as a chain that uses one blend only both to grind and to sell wholesale.

If you go into my work and ask for a kilo of beans I won't even go out the back to get you a bag, I'll just sell you one of the bags I was going to use today.

This is also going to be cheaper most likely than a boutique roaster if you drink a lot of coffee

"1. The intent was never to own a keepstar in enemy space. They had no plan of living there and either it was eventually gonna die to the DRF, or it was going to be sold to them. Any attempt to unanchor it was going to end with a hilarious loss mail that we'd be talking about instead. Idk why we're debating wether or not feeding a KS was cool. 

2. The reason WWB drew so much attention to begin with is that people hate goons for the exact things that GOTG is now doing. Eventually history will repeat itself and GOTG will probably also be evicted. 

3. The distinction is Init isn't forced to kick corps who don't want to participate in a Snuff OP. And Init is allowed to run OPs of the same calibur without permission from snuff. Neither is subservient to the other. That's the key difference, coaltions are *supposed* to be partnerships. If one party always dictates the policies and terms they're not partners.

"I bought a $30k car when I was 22 and making $52k while livin with my parents.

Totally stupid, financially irresponsible decision, which I would 100% do again because that car was fun as hell to drive, and I drove a lot (75,000 miles in 5 years, and half of that time I lived relatively close to work!). I drive a more practical car now, so I spend much less and earn much more, but that car gave me a lot of joy.

"1: When starting a run ask if unsure what trinkets people have. Help combo to make things smoother. 

:A lot of the time people forget, I do this all the time and not everyone has mods on.

2: You can still use barrels that have been hit and are sparking on objectives if your quick enough.

: this is great on the horn of Magnus door event.

3: Getting downed and healing white health gives you  more back then if your low in the red and heal before getting knocked down.

:this is situational as you don't wanna be going down unless in a controlled environment.

4: Certain weapon traits are better suited to difficulties. Bloodlust can be better on lower difficulties due to the skaven having less health. Where as regrowth on nightmare/ cata can be  suitable due to health scaling etc.

: this is something I wish I had known earlier. 

5: Accept that at times friendly fire will happen. Only voice an issue if it's becomes one.

: the amount of cata runs I have done and players freak out over something that happens in close quarters. Makes the situation a lot worse for little to no reason. 

6: Rngjesus will always make sure from time to time you have a bad run/ loot drop.

: just laugh it of and move on. 

7: Have a medic on the team. 

: certain trinkets and builds can make those higher level runs smoother with a players on hand who have the set up.

8: Skill isn't defined by a few mistakes. 

: I see this complaint a lot, about higher level players being bad. A lot of things can influence a choice. It can ruin a run or just slow it down. Even the best have some rough times. I've had my fair share of grim throws in error. 

9: You don't need 5 of the same weapon to upgrade to the next rarity at the blacksmiths. You will have to pay more tokens however. 

: this is great when you get a lower rarity DLC weapon, you know you ain't gonna get again.

10: A poor connection can be worse than any skaven device or soldier. 

: sometimes it's worth looking at location when searching if you internet isn't the best.

"It mostly just comes down to experience and knowledge about the enemy champions (and your own). If you lose (or win) against a Zed one time, you'll know what you bought or didn't do to so. That's a shitty answer tho, you're not gonna get experience from this post, so I'll try to answer better. 

So first of all, you must know your champions core items. Every champions has a core item or 2, or some basically have 5. You need to know them for your champion. Core items are the items you will get next to 100% of your matches playing them. For a lot of mages, this is Morellonomicon. For Fizz it is Lich Bane. For Kassadin it's Rod of Ages. You will know this from just reading a guide, nothing fancy here. 

Second is boots. You mostly get a specific one, likely Sorcs or Lucidity on midlane, but you can also get Mercs or Tabi against a hard lane. Against Morgana, maybe, you may wanna get Mercs if you get hit by Q a lot. Against Yasuo Tabis is a great choice. 

With boots and core items, you will often have room for 3 more items. These are situational, even though in a lot of cases, they are the same. Most mages will want both Deathcap and Void staff in the end, for example, and then you'll have only one more spot left.

Hourglass: Lots of AD on the enemy team, or your lane opponent is Zed/Talon/Yasuo. 

Banshees Veil: The enemy has a huge, important spell they will use to engage on you. Malphite R or Ashe R etc. Not good against poke, they'll just take the spellshield with poke and it'll only be stats after all. Still good against some teams though. 

Liandys Torment: Great against tanks. The %HP damage is really strong if the enemy has a tank or 2 that you have to deal with as a mage. 

There is obviously a lot more. Look at the enemy team while you load into the game and think about what items you may need already then. You don't wanna realize you needed Hourglass when you die to Zeds R the 4th time -- you want to know before the game even starts. 

Most guides will show almost all items you ""can"" go on the champion. Try not to invent a lot by yourself. If you are silver 1 and you know with yourself you aren't good at knowing what to build, don't try. It's great that you realize, it's a step in the right direction, good on you!

Where was the outrage in any of the battlefield titles? They have always had a huge gap between someone with 100 hours and a new player. That's all the mtx does. Give people a jump through the ranks. Whoopdy fucking doo. How is that player any different than one who has just played a lot? That's what matchmaking is for which seems to be working well but still needs tweaks.

As for the star cards. Sure the system would be better to not be designed around mtx. But I was already feeling like I was unlocking stuff at a fairly reasonable rate. Now with the increased credits everything will come a lot faster.

He is the guy who gets to decide what kind of Turkish government is most beneficial to US interests. There is no realpolitik idealism like you envision. People are flawed and real and dirty. So you can either be a US policy maker who thinks that a strong Turkey can control and stop terrorism in the Middle East by controlling the region and make it safe for US business or you can think that Turkey is literally hitler and has to be destroyed and made weak. 

For example, even in the Ottoman era. The Christian suffering meme was a huge influence on European politics and decisions vis a vi Turkey. Think KONY 2012 or various other meme-campaigns. European Christians have always lobbied and influenced their governments for non-rational reasons and emotions-based policies. In the real world, states do not always get to act according to their rational self-interest... there are a million things that get in between and use the state for special interest pet projects.

"In answer to your last question, Christianity and proselytizing are not synonymous in spite of them going hand-in-hand for the loudest group of the bunch (Evangelicals). 

Since this group tends to entertain more divergent lines of thinking from the mainstream Christian bunch, the ban on proselytizing is likely due to the constant barrage of people from the main Christianity sub that come here without realizing what this group is about and it gets annoying. 

Also just a quibble, Communism and authoritarian states are not one in the same from what I understand about the topic. It's a common post-Cold-War American misnomer in both liberal (center-left) and conservative (right) conversation but i don't believe it's really accurate.

"Your emp. You either use it too early or too late. Communicate with your team more. Not sure if they are in voice chat. If not, keep an eye on ults. Your ult is both a combo ult and a neglecting ult. While I only saw a few minutes (on mobile) I noticed that you didn't ult the ulting Moira on defense. You had your translocator ready I think. 

Also before that I noticed the d va alone on point. While you were still able to kill her, I noticed you not using Orisa's shield as cover. You could've easily hacked her earlier and punished her much faster.

Your translocator usage is also subpar. You use it when you are like 3 feet away from it way too often and when you are around half health with only one guy after you. What you do is make it your escape route and hack the close enemy health packs. Especially in that middle building and on the edge. 

Get used to looking at the match list to keep track of Ally ults. 

Edit: between point a takeover and point b defense, you had the chance to hack the big health pack right side of choke.

"Except that purchasing said forest cannot ever be less expensive than lumbering all the trees. Let's analyse 2 scenarios:

S1: No one own the forest until you came along. That means that, for you to own it, you must mix your labor with the land. Simply drawing a line and saying ""Mine!"" will not do. So you must actually protect and take care of every piece of land you consider yours. Lumbering is not easy - you need people, trucks, machines. All that comes with a cost. Your wood must sell for more than what you spent, and when you simply lumber without worrying about planting more (and you're not getting money from, say, hunters who want to hunt there), you will need to maximize your profit. I ask you a question: who will sell wood cheaper? 1. The guy who must pay for the whole operation to never use it again or 2. The guy who can pay for the operation once and use it many times since he will be forever planting the trees there?

S2: The forest was already owned but you bought it. Basically the same scenario of S1, but now you have the additional cost of actually buying the land, making your selling price a lot higher. At this point I see no reason to buy this forest at all except for satisfying your destructive impulses.

Point is, using any long-term producer's goods only one time is always more expensive than using it many times. You're never going to be competitive and will end up having to sell your land, since you won't be in any condition to use it. Thinking that a man who owns a forest will profit by destroying it is the same as thinking that you can open a homebuilding business to build your own house at a lower price.

* Nagato's explanation scene of the thought entity is one of my favorite scenes in the series. The directing works to show how everything sounds so bat shit crazy. The fish eyes lenses-view, showing Kyon in one of Nagato's glasses lense while showing Haruhi in the other, turning things upside down. The whole thing is awesome. 

* I love how self aware this show is.
 * ""Loli, big boobs, a maid, and glasses! Wonderful!"" 
 * Also before the Saturday outing when Kyon has his conversation with Mikuru and Koizumi, Haruhi mentions that the club is meant to find aliens, future men, and espers. The camera matches with Nagato, Mikuru, and Koizumi in turn.

"&gt;I'm wondering how greeting friends or loved ones works when a man is erect.

How does greeting friends or loved ones work when a clothed man is erect?  Why should it be any different because the man is nude?

I understand that the prevailing attitude toward erections in the nudist community tends to be along the lines of ""it doesn't happen, but if it does just cover it up and no one will bother you about it"".  I'm not a fan of that attitude, though, because it seems to reinforce the link society at large mistakenly places between nudity and sex.  I'm hoping that, over time, it shifts more to something like ""erections almost never happen, but if you get one no one will notice as long as you don't do anything with it"".

Try thinking about it in different contexts.  If there was a man with a full on erection sitting, fully clothed, on a bench at the mall and you walked past that bench, would you notice he had an erection?  If you did, would you care?  If you did, would you bring any attention to it?  How about a man wearing a swim suit waiting in line for a water slide at a pool?  I've only ever seen that string of questions (noticing, caring about then mentioning the erection) get three yes answers when the man is nude in a clothing optional area.

So just think of an erect penis in a nudist area the same way you do a flaccid one in a clothed area.  You have to cover it up, not because it's wrong for you to have one or because you should be ashamed of anything, but because the society around you will persecute you if you don't.

&gt;If someone goes in for a hug, is any contact generally seen as accidental or are purposeful steps taken to avoid it?

I actually don't have any experience with any forms of physical intimacy in a nudist environment as I've never been in one with someone I know well enough that they would be appropriate.  By default, though, I would fall back on the same kind of idea.  I'd ask myself if a certain act would be appropriate if everyone in the area were clothed and apply the same level of appropriateness even though everyone in the area is nude.

After all, the most basic concept of nudism is that the null outfit is just another outfit in your wardrobe so there's no reason for anything to change just because you're wearing it instead of any of the others.",Keslen,1512432032,nudism

"Ownership of anything is not, and has never been a right, but a privilege governed by the rules and laws of a government. You have no inherent right to possess any resource.

Those dollar notes in your pocket were created by the government, and are only worth what everyone in society believe they are worth. The only reason you believe they are worth anything is because the government says that is what they are worth, and they provide backing for it (eg. via laws etc).

Now in order for you to be able to use those dollars in your pocket, laws are in place to create a fair and equitable marketplace (ie via contract laws etc) so that trade of resources (eg labour, minerals etc) can take place. The dollars represent the worth of said resources. 

The government also provides essential services such as security, education, health, welfare, research etc which help to provide a fairer society for all. In order to provide all necessary services, they are owed resources from the members of society especially from those who can contribute those resources. 

Take this hypothetical example of a hunter gatherer society. They have a chieftain (ie government), 3 hunters, 3 caregivers and 3 children. Only one hunter was successful, but he brought down two deer. The chieftain passed a law stating that the hunter can only keep a small portion of one of the deer for himself while the rest gets shared with the rest of the tribe equally.

If the hunter tries to claim both deer for himself because they are ""his"" then he is just being greedy and deliberately ignoring the benefits he gains from being part of the tribe, as well as ignoring the contribution from every other member, even those who are not able to hunt for themselves.

TL/DR : Tax is never theft, but debt that is owed in order to participate in society. ",Darkwind85,1512432032,changemyview

"I believe two item descriptions, a lore note, and two rare dialogues explains this.  These are all my opinion not canon.  

* The Moon Caryll Rune description:

&gt;The Great Ones that inhabit the nightmare are sympathetic in spirit, and often answer when called upon.

Laurence established the healing church and conducted blood ministrations which started Yharnam’s beast plague.   He used Gherman’s aid to repel the scourge and set up the healing church hunters once the scourge spread further.

Once Laurence and the hunters realized the scourge couldn’t be held by their own order, Laurence used a cord to contact a sympathetic Great One, the Moon Presence, to help end the beast scourge.  This ritual may have happened in the Abandoned Workshop where you find the ritual cord. 

* One Third of Umbilical Cord (Workshop) description:

&gt;Every Great One loses its child, and then yearns for a surrogate. The Third Umbilical Cord precipitated the encounter with the pale moon, which beckoned the hunters and conceived the hunter's dream.

The sympathetic ‘pale moon’ Great One provided the hunters with powers transcending human comprehension to defeat the source of the beast scourge and established the Hunter’s dream, allowing these hunters to cheat death until their hunt was completed. 

Why do I believe Laurence contacted the Moon Presence for aid?

* Lore note in Lecture Building:

&gt;The nameless moon presence beckoned by Laurence and his associates. Paleblood.

No explanation necessary :p

* Gehrman’s secret dialogue:

&gt;Oh, Laurence... what's taking you so long... I've grown too old for this, of little use now, I'm afraid...

&gt;Oh, Laurence... Master Willem... Somebody help me... Unshackle me please, anybody... I've had enough of this dream... The night blocks all sight... Oh, somebody, please... 

Those dialogues seem to imply Gehrman is waiting for Laurence and his men to finish the hunt with the aid of the Moon Presence’s hunters.

Answering your second question.
&gt;Does the plague of beasts, the healing church, etc. exist in the waking world? 

They all exist in the waking world imo and the game cannot be more clear about it.  The headstones in the Hunter's Dream are called ""Headstones of Awakening"" and it prompts you to select an area to awake in.

IMO the only areas in the game that are in another plane/nightmare world are the ones that explicitly stated as nightmare or dreams:

* Nightmare Frontier, Nightmare of Mensis
* Lecture Building: Given this area serve as a hub to the above nightmare worlds.  It could be existing in both real/nightmare world like the Abandoned Workshop &amp; the Hunter's Dream.
* The Hunter's Nightmare

One final lore note of importance is also found in the Lecture Building that neatly wraps up this story:

&gt; The Mensis ritual must be stopped, lest we all become beasts.

This note proves the beast plague is linked with the Mensis ritual.  Upon halting the Mensis Ritual, you have completed Laurence's end of the bargain with the Moon Presence and Gerhman offers your hunter a chance to awaken back to the waking world.

**TLDR:**  I believe Laurence bargained with the sympathetic Moon Presence to gain its aid in defeating another source of nightmare that is causing Yharnam’s beast plague.

The sympathetic Moon Presence agreed under the condition that the hunters blessed with its power are to serve the Moon Presence.  This resulted in the creation of the Hunter’s Dream and Gehrman becoming its surrogate child.

When you defeat the source of the scourge and free Gehrman, the Moon Presence appears because the Great One has lost its child and it forces you to become its new surrogate child.

Events also mostly take place in a real world.

Headshots me and kills me. In the midst of a giant patch of bushes. I have no idea where he was and didn't even get a chance to find out. It was the most bullshit thing that's ever happened to me in the game because there was no way he could have seen me due to all the foliage I was in the middle of yet he got a clear headshot on me that killed me.",PyroGameMaster23,1512432034,PUBG

"As you mentioned, there are several overlaps between social anxiety disorder and autism.

The key difference between the two is the **cause** of the symptoms.

For example, someone with *social anxiety disorder* would avoid nonverbal behaviours (e.g. eye contact) because that would make them **anxious**.  

Someone with autism would lack the fundamental understanding to use nonverbal communication.  Anxiety does not prevent them from conducting nonverbal communication.  However, they can get anxious from not being able to understand nonverbal communication.

Anxiety is not a requirement for an autism diagnosis, but it is required in social anxiety disorder.

"**First Time Watcher**

* Wow we’re jumping right back into it here. The baseball game made me forget all about the tension in the room. Im still confused as to what Yuki is, she says she’s an alien but her word choices and mannerisms seem much more like a machine. 

* When the fuck did they leave the [earth](https://i.imgur.com/5X8LZLj.png)

* She keeps talking about an entity. Is that who “made” her? Or is she simply part of the entity like a hive mind?

* Of course Haruhi is an enigma, just look at that [face](https://i.imgur.com/q4dR2z4.png)

* When did I start watching Evangelion? 

* ”She does not take the information you feed her seriously” Aww poor Kyon 

* That was an intense conversation, I had to go back and watch it three times and I still don’t think I was able to absorb it all.  What I took away from it was that Haruhi has some sort of special power thats significant to the fate of the universe and she, herself is not aware of this power. Also there will be people who will want to hurt her for some reason and in order to do that they will target Kyon.

* Cmon [Kyon](https://i.imgur.com/ytaW8w0.png) we just went over this she doesnt listen to a word you say.

* Godamnit Haruhi can we just make it though one episode without you kidnapping someone?

* Man the plot just keeps coming, now we officially get a name for the guy in the ED, the reason why he was brought into the club and finally what the club is all about. (Finding cool shit and hanging out with it. I know [Kyon](https://i.imgur.com/qDcNCS7.png) just be brave)

* GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF [BEST GIRL](https://i.imgur.com/EtyfJve.png)

* The sad look of [defeat](https://i.imgur.com/czm3xNI.png)

* HARHUI PUT THAT DAMN [CAMERA](https://i.imgur.com/GtvXpbG.png) AWAY 

* ”Alright now lets all have some fun with Mikuru!”………Im just not even going to touch that 

* Dont know if I’m just hearing things but it sounded like Haruhi was disappointed in the group pairings. On the other hand score one for Kyon for getting some alone time with best girl! 

* ”This is not a date!” bro its totally a date 

* Annnnd there’s the timetravler! Well her arrival makes Yuki’s story much more credible 

* Hmm Kyon is very important to Haruhi, thats now twice we heard this. I really wanna know why this is because she doesnt seem to listen to anything he says. I wish Mirkuru would have said more but its hard to mad at someone being so cute 

* UGGGGHHH Its so [cute](https://i.imgur.com/GkfojQS.png) it hurts 

* So now I’m really curious, if Haruhi can manipulate her surroundings why couldn’t she make it so she and Kyon ended up in the same group?

* oh man she’s pissed. Kyon better learn how to lie or he might actually die by her wrath 

* Now we have our full cast of characters and the plot has grown exponentially. It looks like the new guy regards Haruhi as God, and thats both hysterical and terrifying. 

**Overall**

Really solid episode toda, Kyon’s faces were on point. The musical accompaniment was amazing, my favorite was that nice Jazz when the transfer student was talking to Kyon. The animation was pretty top notch too, with the dark/drab colors for Yuki to the bright and sunny stuff for Mikuru.  Each episode just keeps getting better and better. Looks like tomorrow will be another time skip but now that the bulk of the plot seems to be laid out I think it’ll make a lot more sense.

&gt; Not discussing this.

I brought up Xbox as an example of a device that had the interface shoehorned in, despite not working as well as what was implemented on previous devices. 

I can tell it’s a good example, too, because you don’t even want to bother with defending that, but the fact of the matter is, Metro was implemented the same way on Windows 8. It was part of an obvious company-wide “tablets first” mantra, but the problem with that is that people don’t look to Microsoft for tablets.

&gt; It works best.

"&gt;Is Yahweh, Allah, and the Christian god all the same god?

No, if you mean ""Are the Gods that Jewish, Muslim, and Christian people worship the same?"" For Christians, God can be called Yahwah, Allah, or God, but this God is different than what is described as God by Islam or modern Judaism. The major difference is the acceptance of the divinity and saving role of Jesus. Jesus himself says, ""For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him."" (John 5:22–23) This idea is repeated in the Bible, prominently in John and 1 John.

&gt;Those words just mean ""god"" in arabic/Hebrew, right?

Yes, but the meaning we put into words matters, which is what I was getting at with the above statements that Muslims, Jews, and Christians mean something different by ""God.""

&gt;What If I believe in ""God"", but don't conform to a religion? Would God forsake me?

Jesus is clear that the only salvation is through him, he is the only way to be reconciled to the Father. ""Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'"" (John 14:6) Everyone has fallen away from God, rebelled against him. It's not enough to just believe in a god. That is what Paul was explaining to the Greeks in Acts 17:16-34, and that is what he explained in Romans 1:18 - 3:20. Believing in a ""god"" who is not the God of Christianity is idolatry, a grave sin.

But God gave us a to be reconciled to him, to find him, through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. He died for us, taking on our sin and defeating death, that we could be righteous in the sight of the holy God and that we could be conformed to the image of Christ, saved from the consequence of sin and separation from God. If we have faith in Jesus, believe that Jesus is Lord and that he is the Son of God who was resurrected, then God is your reward, and eternal life.

You review the campaign front, kill the previous session's adventure fronts, and write new adventure fronts for the next session.

What we actually do varies, like my campaign fronts are more like sentence fragments, and I stopped writing stakes questions out of laziness. But don't completely throw the baby out with the bathwater.

"Thank you! I found the raw asset on Sounddogs and then processed it to make it a little less present, and to loop seamlessly. 

There's a pretty simple technique where you can take your file, split it down the middle, and then drag the front half around behind the back half, cross-fading what was the tail of the sound into the head. 

That way, your sound is a perfect seamless loop, and you don't have to worry about any digital clicks because the sample at the end of the new file is already basically the same amplitude as the sample at the beginning of the file.

You can use that basic idea to eliminate loud spots, catches, basically anything that signals to the ear that the sound has started over. 

My biggest pet-peeve with looped sounds in games (though this really stopped being an issue after the PS2 era) is that often times the loop would have one really distinctive moment, or a broader ebb and flow to it that would make it really obvious when the loop was starting over. So I really do everything I can to make it smooth and uniform. ",SpencerKayR,1512432044,gamedev

"Except this is a narrative piece not an informative piece.

Allow me to give you the informative version. The one that news stations should give... but sadly fail to do so.

**So what actually happened here?**

Well simply put. An Individual by the name of Lucian Wintrich, decided to hold a speech on the topic of ""It is OK to be White"".  about the nefarious role identity politics play in today’s cultural and political landscape, as well as the causation of chaos brought about the phrase “It Is OK to Be White” and how that innocuous string of words pointed out the left’s bigotry.

Finding the speech was incredibly difficult. But after finding it the speech boils down to three points. To point out the hate from the PC crowd, The power of misleading a crowd, and finally ending with the hate from the ultra conservative side. That said however... needless to say this speech was not really.... um.... ""Popular"". In fact alot of people were not really enthused about it. So they went to boo him while he did his speech. Purely based on the title of the speech

That said **Let's get to the interesting stuff** . 

So as I said the audience was filled with those who did not want the speech to happen and one pair of the audience members... a man and woman... decided to go up to his podium and... stole his speech. This was planned in the videos you can see her giving the man the signal to distract the speaker. Needless to say the speaker decided to try to get his speech back. And went after the girl.  According to video at least from the one I saw. He grabbed the backpack of the girl then the shoulder while she was climbing the stairs resulting in the girl stumbling and losing her footing and her falling down. Also bringing down Mr. Wintrich while he attempted to grab his speech back.

The police/security was very active in immediately grabbing and bringing Mr. Wintrich out of the room at this point (more then likely for his safety as again the audience wasn't really on good terms with him). And later he was arrested for assault.

Please keep in mind this is an active investigation... and that does not mean that he was charged with assault. He was arrested for assault. Very similar but different.

**Who is Lucian Wintrich**

I know by now some of you are wondering... who is this guy I've never heard of him. And don't worry your not alone. At least as far as I was concerned.

Lucian Wintrich is a Blogger for the Gateway Pundit. And was kind of a well known... ""Eccentric"" so to say. He say's it himself. That he enjoys it when other journalist ""lose their minds"" when they see his work. And started the twink4trump tag. Which was Gays for Trump.

**Some video Links**

Angle 2 - https://twitter.com/KallMeKG/status/935690274902298629

Whole thing - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJy3KOdyEus

**Is Lucian Wintrich protected by the law**

One law in particular is flying around during this incident. That boils down to essentially. ""allowing ""reasonable physical force"" to the extent reasonably believed to be necessary to regain property reasonably believed to have been acquired by larceny"". 

Or in basic talk ""If people take your shit... you can forcefully take it back as long you don't do crazy shit to do so"". For example It's okay for you to say tackle a purse thief to get your purse back... But not okay for you to dome someone with a tire iron for taking a stick of gum. Its a delicate balance of... you take your stuff back... but you didn't go apeshit.

That's some fantasy shit. As for partners not wanting to help; yes, it's contradictory. Yes, it's annoying. But you ultimately can't make them. Let them complain. There's not much you can do there. I'm sorry you're disheartened. I would appreciate you. I constantly come in early, cover shifts, work hard without complaint, and I don't hear a word.

Localized game is for those who do not know foreign languages. That is still the majority and you won't see their opinions here because they do not know english language.

What my post says is that slang words have no place in localized, translated games simply because they are borrowed slang words.

What the people like OP do is to get attention with drama mongering and personal attacks and get lots and lots of these slang words into the game because, and that's their argument, ""you can't throw a word from localization into Google Translate, then do that again and get the same word"". This is ridiculous, you are never going to get the same word because this is a machine, it never gets you the same word.

"The more ""humane-seeming"" methods are often the least humane, in terms of the suffering of the executed person.

Drugs? Frequently botched.

Hanging: If done properly, the body muscles are paralyzed almost instantly... and the brain dies of asphyxiation, perhaps minutes later. Unconsciousness is probably a matter of seconds, mercifully. If done without proper drop, or with a choke-knot instead of using the fall to break the neck, it can take minutes.

Firing squad: Pretty much the same, so long as the bullet hits the heart. 

Guillotine: guaranteed minutes to death; seconds to unconsciousness. 

Shotgun blast to the head: instantaneous brain death, but messy and unpleasant to the observers. However, note it's still by far the most humane method so far...

Gas: Ranging from excruciating pain to silent, blissful release of life, depending on what is used. The human gasping reflex is triggered by CO2 levels, not oxygen absence (nor poison gas presence). You can simply and rather pleasantly end a person's life with laughing gas. However, thanks to the nazis, this isn't a pathway modern nations are likely to ever use again.",IAmBroom,1512432049,morbidlybeautiful
"Boi, if you think that the Wt. Auf. Pz IV has a playstyle similar to the Borsig, then you’re gonna be in for a wooooorrrrrrrrlllllllldddddd of pain. Since I am getting ready to soon make the next tech tree Tuesday, I feel like doing a small guide, so let’s breakdown the WT’s Playstyle! :D

With the Borsig, you are usually able to play a bit aggressively, thanks to the powerful gun, your Turret, and your extremely low profile. With the WT unfortunately, this is not often the case.... 

At tier 8 with the RHM, most of your oppenents have medium size health pools and weak armor that can be shot through with HE. Also, there are a plethora of light tanks, so you can always rank up that sweet delicious damage. 

At tier 9, with the WT, your opponents begin to have much larger healthpools and even stronger armor, while you still deal out the exact same damage like the RHM did. There are practically zero light tanks (except for the T-54 Ltwt and RU-251), and so HE is usually saved for those rare instances where one crosses your line of sight or you see the rear of an enemy vehicle.

Now, is the WT mobile? Yes it is. Far more mobile than the RHM in fact, since it is on a medium tank hull. However, that is the downside. YOU ARE DRIVING IN A TIER 5 MEDIUM TANK HULL AGAINST OPPONENTS THAT ARE AS HIGH AS TIER 10. That measly amount of armor that covers your front hull can be penetrated by almost every single gun you will go up against. Also, thanks to the hull size, your profile and turret are much higher above the ground than the RHM’s was, so you are a larger target in the crosshairs of an enemy.

Now, if you were somebody who plays with the derp gun on the RHM, I’d immediately be crying because you would have an aggressive playstyle. 

#However, as I am writing this comment, I just reread the post and realized that you said that you play with the stock gun. Well played, OP. I’ve been bamboozled by myself.

————————————————-————————————————-

**Ignore the pointless drivel that i wrote above. That advice is for the players that play the RHM with the derp gun and think the WT is the same. The stuff underneath is for people who will actually know how to play the WT effectively once they get it.**

Ok, so since you’ve been playing with the stock gun on the RHM, you probably aren’t usually on the frontlines that often yes? That is a very good thing. It means you are definetely going to enjoy the WT much more with its 12.8cm gun. 

Basically with the 12.8cm gun, the WT is exactly like the Borsig except with a higher profile and one other thing the Borsig does not have.... gun depression. Now, this may sound weird at first, but if you turn the Turret of the WT towards the rear, you suddenly have very little gun elevation but a lot more gun depression. This basically allows you to sneak up hills, shoot over them at the enemy, and then zip away. Honestly, you are going to probably love the tank. Maybe even marry it.

Overall, 10/10 meme for making me bamboozle myself. Gg OP.",CrazyTom54,1512432049,WorldOfTanksBlitz

"The frapp goo will have a grid with 2/3/4 on the front. This is according to t/g/v. This is also the amount of scoops of things (frap chips, can bean powder, matcha etc) and the pumps of frap roast the sizes get. 

For coffee based fraps:
-pump frap roast into the cup
-pour whole milk (or non dairy) to bottom line of cup 
-dump contents into specific blender
-add syrups (ie mocha etc) into blender and/or add inclusions 
-pump goo into blender 
-add specific scoop of ice
-blend on #1 

Sequencing is the same for creme based but omit the frap roast. 

Coffee fraps are just frap roast, milk, goo and ice. No whip. Same for espresso fraps however these,in addition to frap roast, also get shots. 
No whip. 

Café vanilla frap is a coffee frap vanilla bean powder according to size. This gets whip. 

Green tea creme fraps also get classic syrup. 
I believe strawberry and creme also gets classic. 

When I was a green bean I could never remember which ones get the mocha topping. CHIPS GET THE DRIP is how I remember.

"Not sure what you mean by ""doesn't fit in a system""?  Are you referring to the naming convention (eg - 4K)?  In that case, it does :

480p = ED (0.4mp)

720p = HD (0.9mp)

1080p = FullHD (2.0mp)

1440p = QuadHD (3.7mp)

2160p = UltraHD (8.3mp)

You can see that each resolution is roughly double the pixel count of the lower resolution, so QuadHD fits in perfectly between FullHD 1080p and UltraHD 4K.",red286,1512432052,bapcsalescanada

"You never will actually stop comparing yourself, it’s human to do so and serves it’s purposes. The main thing to realize is that your idea of yourself and the actual you as an organism in the real universe are completely different. For example: your self identity says nothing about how your able to breath or open and close your hands, it has nothing to do with your hypothalamus or how your cells multiply. Any label or identity you put on yourself in inherently incomplete. In other words, you don’t need to worry about how you measure up because your making up your own rules of measurements, it’s an illusion that your ego has tricked you into believing is reality. 


It’s important to realize that knowing is an outward thing not an inward thing. No one ever actually “knows” themselves. Just like a finger can’t touch itself, light can’t light itself and a box can’t hold itself.  The act of knowing and understanding something is limited to our senses and conscious thought, which leave a lot of information out. 

On a deeper level your problem really starts with having the desires in the first place. Try and let go of those, and you may realize that you already have everything you want. ",vastair,1512432052,selfimprovement

"If you get into one of those moods where you feel like you're spiralling into something and you can't control what you're about to say or do, take a step back, put your phone down, and don't engage in anything. Just don't. Some things you can't take back, so know when you need to withdraw. You can always bring it up later when you've calmed down, but you don't need to do it while you're going bonkers on the inside.

Don't make permanent decisions when you're riled up, ever. But don't suppress your feelings forever either. Bring things up if they're still taking up a lot of space when you're not cycling.

If you want to be with him, you need to work on it, especially on the days where it's hard and you feel like you don't deserve him. Everyone deserves love, including you. Show him who you are, tell him about your bad days and your fears, and if he still wants to be with you, try not to doubt it so much. He picked you for a reason. And in case he decides it's too much for him to handle, it's so much better to deal with that now than to postpone the hurt.

"Are you playing WH 2nd ed? If so, that could be a contributing factor. One major issue with the way the system is set up is that combat is a preferable solution in most encounters statistically. This makes them seem inevitable. 

The reason is that most skills are about 30-40%, they go up as you progress, but your combat skills rise at the same rate as social skills (so the chance of success in combat is always greater). 

In a social situation, when you have a 30-40% skill, you fail most of the time and it is final. In combat, you can fail a couple of times (also called missing) and still win. Social actions are binary, while combat is situation dependent and heavily influenced by included mini-games and tactics.

Consider if the system were completely unchanged except that combat was a single die roll with the same skill. Succeed, and you survive, fail, and you die. Now how much would players go out of their way to avoid those situations?

A lot.

That is basically life as a social character in the system. Many people just give bonuses to social skills, but this is not the rules as written (average difficulty does not add to the skill level, but easy does). This means that it takes a lot of GM effort and player skill to support doing social stuff consistently.

Hence, fight. A lot.",clutchheimer,1512432053,rpg

That was his choice, like it was mine to kick him out when I found out. 

So yeah I am sorry for my part in us drifting apart and becoming complacent in our marriage. I thought we were strong that nothing could have broken us apart. I am sorry for not seeing how wrong I was, and because of that I did not see you were cheating with multiple women over the last year we were together because I trusted you. I am sorry for being so busy making a life for us that I failed to see that our life together was already over, because you thought you could betray me and I would never leave you.

 &gt;Let's say you received three payments to a Trezor on three different addresses, and you want to avoid blockchain analysis linking those three addresses together.

&gt;Can you send all the money from a certain address, and not the others?

&gt;Alternatively, is there any way to avoid ""mixing"" these three addresses into a single transaction?",BitcoinAllBot,1512432061,BitcoinAll

"Heaps has something like 30 rappels in it. Last time we did it, we all carried a short rope to rappel with.  Immediately before the 90 m rappel is a 43 m and an 18 m rappel. Those last three raps are back to back and have small loading platforms. So the system used is one person goes down first with a 25 m rope, a 50 m, and a 90 m. They rig all the rappels as single strand raps. When the last person comes, they carry a couple of the short handlines (20 m total). As they come down they pull the other ropes. Now they are at the top of the 90 m rap with  100 m of rope. They tie all the the other ropes together into a long pull cord and rap that way. ",extrablue,1512432061,canyoneering

"**John and Caitlin Matthews**

John Matthews (born 1948) and Caitlín Matthews (born 1952) are English writers. Together, they have written over 150 books, translated into more than thirty languages, including Tarot packs, a card-based storytelling system, screenplays, songs and other works.

Beginning to work together in London in the 1970s, they wrote and published The Western Way in 1985. This followed the lead of Christine Hartley's The Western Mysteries Tradition (1968) by identifying and promoting a European mystical tradition to offset the then-current domination of Eastern mysticisms from India and China.

"I'd like to make a link in the sticky thread that has all the ways the Messiah was foreshadowed like this - would this be something you would be interested in doing? I came across some other good examples (which is more on how Moses' life events foreshadowed the Messiahs):

Both survived a infant persecution. (Exodus 1:22; Matthew 2:16)

Moses refused wealth. (Hebrews 11:24) Jesus refused wealth. (Matthew 4:8-9)

Moses found a woman at a well. (Exodus 2:15) Jesus talks to women at well. (John 4:6)

Moses was a great law giver. (22:40) Jesus was a great law giver.

Moses was a judge. (Judges 18:13) Christ is a judge. (2 corinthians 5:10 )

Exodus 3:1 - Moses was a good sheppard. Jesus was a shepphard, willing to lie down his life for sheep.

Moses' encountered serpents in the wilderness. Jesus defeated a serpent in wilderness.

Both came down to teach and save from a mountain. Moses was shining after coming down the mountain. (Exodus 34:33) Jesus was shining in the mountain. (Matthew 17:2)

Exodus 17:4/Numbers 14 - Attempted stonings would have taken place for Moses. John 8:59 - An attempted stoning was done to Jesus.

Moses fasted 40 days/nights mountain. So did Jesus.

Moses' leads 12 princes (Numbers 1:44) Jesus lead 12 apostles who will sit on thrones (Matthew 19:29)

Luke 10: Jesus sent out 70 disciples. Exodus 24: Moses' had 70 leading elders.

Jesus' sent the Holy Spirit and is with us through it. Numbers 11:17 - God stated he would take Moses' spirit and put it on the 70 elders.

Moses was sent to deliver people from slavery. Jesus was sent to deliver and ""proclaim liberty."" (Luke 4:18)

Moses built a temple (physical type). Jesus Built a temple (spiritual type - John 2:19)

Jesus stated he was ""meek and lowly"" (Matthew 11:29) Numbers 12:3 - Moses was said to be meek.

Moses had willingness to lay down his life. (Exodus 32:32) Jesus had willingness to lay down life.",wallet_man,1512432062,messianic

"Metal Gear Vendetta was pure bliss to play and experience. However, like how many out there that have already stated(as well as you) there just seemed a lot of. emptiness within. For Metal Gear's history, it's very impersonal even if that was the whole point. Sure, it ""works"" but the lack of refinement in regards to the actual direction within it is not very coherent and tangible.

I am a long time fan of the franchise as well as being generally a big fan of open ended games. Sadly, while the openness works marvalously within in context to missions, the breadth of that world is highly derivative. Much as you expressed, it's just a void. More or less it's just a hub for a borderless junta. It was not even necessary. What it needed was a better sense of direction. Things to explore and discover, denser wild life ecosystems, the added ability of MGS3 style survival elements that allowed for animals to act as food source rather than ZooTycoon:Battlefield Edition. Give us more secret tapes obtainable throughout the wild with some good context to them besides 10 seconds of some dude shitting himself. Give it atmosphere and make it personal in context to the locations. Elder Scrolls, Fallout, any Rockstar game at least gives you something to at least look at while feeling like you are in a living breathing world, even if it's lifeless like Fallout.

There really should had been rival PF turf wars as well. Give us something to do next outside with this gameplay rather than run, tranq a goat, and hide from one lone cargo truck. Give me a reason to sneak around beyond the guard posts. Anything. Maybe choose sides covertly like in games such as Mercenaries from Pandemic. Different PF factions nets unique rewards and changes the geopolitical landscape around you.

"No, some fighters have a great night, put on great performances and still don't win. 

Clearly Woodley wizened up as he is now the welterweight champion.

GSP and Rory are both well rounded but that does not mean GSP can do what Rory can do and vice-versa. You're also making the massive assumption Woodley would still lose to that gameplan. It's been a long time since Woodley took that L.

Smart fighters grow from losses. Woodley is evidently a smart fighter.

For a fighter with a bad gas tank, Woodley sure has done well for himself going 5 rounds in his last 3 fights. Look, he might not be a marathon runner, but Woodley's conservatively/explosive style allows is underpinned by his ability to pace himself and measure his output efficiently.

GSP has outwrestled wrestlers that were better at pure wrestling. Wrestling in MMA is a different beast altogether. Woodley has made people look completely helpless on the ground from top position. As soon as he knocks someone down, they tend to get held down and pulled unconscious. 

Woodley outpoint Wonderboy, who GSP himself heralded as the best striker in the UFC. He's also much faster than GSP. I don't have any doubt GSP is gonna go to sleep in that match up. None.",MightyNuts,1512432064,MMA

i also don't think that they gonna give them out for an one time practice, since nobody should know about the kwamis, and with them giving out a miraculous temporary, they would give away some secrets as well.

"I find Australia to be interesting because, like Britain, their firearm homicide rate is absurdly low compared to here in the United States. I don't think I would rely on your source considering it cites its own article as the ""two studies"", but here is the Australian Institute of Criminology's report on homicide weapon statistics:

http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide/weapon.html

Now I agree it is probably up for debate whether the ban on guns actually had much of an impact on the firearm homicide rate, but I think that they are better off doing so. The reason I cite mass shootings is because it is an example of one person causing a relatively large amount of damage. It is clear that it is easier for one person to inflict harm to scores of people here than it is in Australia, which I think is NOT a good thing.  Would you suggest a different statistic for measuring that?


Regarding your question: I do not drink alcohol myself (yes I am over 21), but I do not believe that alcohol should be banned. Just like with any potentially dangerous thing, be it automobiles or guns or alcohol, I think there should be limitations. When in a public setting, such as in a bar, maybe it would be best to limit how much alcohol could be served to an individual to avoid them from being shit-faced drunk. I know that there are bars that generally instill some limitation, but maybe it would best as a state/federal policy? But no, I do not think alcohol should be banned, just like I don't think ALL guns should be banned, or just like I think automobiles should not be banned.

"There are lots of different platform perches out there - some are wire platforms, some are wooden platforms, some are just a whole bunch of dowel rods on a diagonal.... lots of things to try.  My GCCs with foot issues prefer the solid wood ones, but your girl may like others.

If gripping the perches she has is an issue, you might want to get some vet tape.  You can wrap it around the perches and it should make them more textured so they are easier to grip. 

I staggered the platform perches in my cage so that if anyone fell there would always be a place to land really close by.  I also used to either shield the bird with my other hand if they were perched on my finger (so they are protected if they lost their balance) or in the case of one of my babies with a disabled foot, have her step up directly into my palm rather than on a finger.  Might be something to think about if she is having a hard time on your hands.

Ok so you add more boxes, they can fill.  Why are you supposed to stopping launches if all rocket science boxes are full?    Being resilient to back pressure is just good design why avoid three mouse clicks?

We can have the best of both worlds, you can add all the boxes you want and also stop it if they happen to fill.

The main reason I don’t just pile up tons in boxes is that I like my factories to be end-to-end runnable on-demand.   For example I don’t want huge quantities of iron plate in boxes, I prefer to ensure that smelting can keep up with production.  So if I stop something it’ll (eventually) reduce or stop production all the way back to the mines.

That is not the only way to play, just what I like.   You do you, there is no right way.  I’m just confused why you would rather a possibility of lost rocket science if you are distracted killing biters and forget to add a box.

"I've done it for UPS. Quite simple, just a little bit legwork that's all it takes. I'd imagine FedEx is similar too.

1. If UPS already showed up at your door, just decline the package and tell them you will clear it through CBSA yourself. If you're proactive, you can call UPS while your package is enroute and they will simply hold it at their Dublin depot once it arrives.
2. Go to the Dublin depot and enter the customs clearance office area (you have to go around to the door facing Rte 90) and ask for your package's invoice and clearing documents.
3. Take those documents to CBSA (UPS Winnipeg will tell you which location to go to Sargent or Wellington), pay the taxes and duties (if applicable) and they will stamp your documents.
4. Go back to UPS and show the document to customs clearance office and they will also stamp or take a copy of it.
5. Collect your package.

There's no special knowledge required at all, no forms to fill out, nothing. All you need to do is bring documents from point A to point B, pay, and bring documents back to point A. UPS will make it sound like ""clearing it yourself"" requires special tax/customs knowledge, but it literally requires no knowledge other than driving and finding the CBSA address. There are two CBSA offices, one on Wellington across from Victoria Inn and one on 2019 Sargent Ave. Ask UPS when you pick up your documents and they'll tell you which one to go to.

"&gt; If the object becomes null then shouldn't all the references to it return null as well?

Objects don't become null, references become null.  C# cannot deallocate objects until all references to that object are cleared.  Or, I should say, all references reachable from one of the stack roots or a static reference.  The way C# deallocates memory is to wait until there are no more references to it and then lets the garbage collector return it to free memory.  The way _that_ works is to start at every object root (such as stacks for each of the threads) and to mark every object there are reachable, then every object those objects reference as reachable, and then every one _those_ objects reference as reachable, etc.  It will then sweep all the objects looking for unreachable objects and deallocate those.

"lol...it's not BS....normally each country would have it's own currency, but in the Eurozone all countries share the Euro, but have separate national budgets. This makes it so that Euro productions costs and the value of the Euro is derived from the entire EU as a whole, while at the same time (and I'm guessing we all agree on this second part) German labor is on average far more production than say Greek labor. What this does it is makes German (a relatively ""rich country"") exports way cheaper than they would be under their own currency and imports more expensive, but for Greece (which is ""poor"" relative to Eurozone countries) it makes exporting far more expensive and imports far cheaper than they otherwise would be under separate currencies for each country.

I 100% agree that the debt issues and Southern Europe overspending are an issue for sure, but part of this stems from them having artificially uncompetitive labor costs due to being on the Euro. I also 100% agree that Greece shouldn't be on the Euro...boot them out...it's actually ironic how they continually vote to stay in the Eurozone, yet don't want to pay debts and/or continue austerity. Realistically they should just default and re-establish the Drachma...yes they'll have some short-term issues, piss off the Germans who have bailed them out many times, but long-term the Greeks will be way better off. 

The inherent issue with the Euro is that you either have to have all budgets be under a ""federal"" government for all countries or you have to have separate currencies. The way it stands now, countries are literally incentivized to borrow+spend a ton and ""devalue the Euro"" because each country gains the benefits of the borrowing, but when the debt goes up and inflation eventually comes in (inflation historically has usually followed massive government overspending...look at Venezuala, Zimbabwe, any deveoping nation, etc.) it will be across the entire Eurozone. 

For the record I am 100% pro-german in this situation...Germany knows how to be fiscally responsible, but Germany does also derive benefits to the detriment of other countries by being on the Euro. 

Below are a few well-written pieces about the issue, one of which is by Ben Bernanke, the ex-head of the US Federal Reserve...pretty sure he has a darn good grasp of both economics and the issue he is writing about:

"Definitely go to an endocrinologist or primary care physician.  Get lab work done and make them explain the results to you.  
If your TSH or other levels are only slightly off, see what their stance is on medicating anyway, since you're showing symptoms.

"&gt;  if you give the monkeys a thousand typewriters they will eventually end up with Shakespeare......eventually.  
  
What the fuck is that even supposed to mean in this context?  
  
&gt; Want 3 meter vacuum, then why isn't it 10 metres  
  
That's exactly what happened. Even before we were given pseudo-univac. Players asked, and asked, and asked, for UniVac, instead they said they're gonna nerf it, split into 3 mods, and still leave it to sentinels. Then they blown the drama around it waaaay out of proportion, and finally decided to give us normal vacuum on all sentinels.  
  
&gt; Also Warframe isn't Diablo  
  
How is that relevant? Diablo is also an ARPG, which warframe isn't, hack&amp;slash, which WF isn't, and is way more succesfull. This argument is baseless and irrelevant.  
  
&gt; no univac encourages players to move around  
  
It encourages people to take sentinel, is what it does. Last time they showed the stats, 90% of players used carrier - only it had the vacuum at that time.  
  
&gt; would just stick in one place on for example a defence mission and just leech  
  
Leech from what? Leeches aren't a symptom of vacuum. Defence, mob def - those missions require you to stay in one place, same with interception. Only exterminate, capture, spy and rescue don't encourage you somehow to stay in one place.  
  
&gt; Trust in DE's ability to keep Warframe up to date and if you don't like it that the devs have final say over the game then leave.  
  
Put up or shut up attitude usually leaves both parties unsatisfied - devs lose players, players lose the game. Also, it's retarded - if you call your game a beta, that means it still requires feedback.",lelo1248,1512432078,Warframe

"Hard to say with the check engine light being on.  That could be anything from a purge valve, mass airflow sensor, O2 sensor, coil, etc.  Could be multiple things as well.  Only way to know would be to get the code(s).  Autozone will let you borrow their tool to do this.  ABS modules can be pricey, but there are a few places, such as BBA-Reman, that will repair them for around $250-300.  Again, that's not a given that's what it is.  It could just be a bad ABS sensor or something else.  The low tire pressure warning is most likely one or more dead TPMS sensors and would probably be around $250 to replace all of them, including mounting and balancing.  Many people just wait until the next time they replace tires to have them done.

Is this guy just guessing that the sensors are bad or has he had someone look at the car?  If he has an estimate, that would be helpful in knowing what's going on.",bschmidt25,1512432083,whatcarshouldIbuy

"You're making the same mistake a lot of revisionists do, where you try to retrofit data to support a psychoanalyst position when in reality it had nothing to do with psychoanalysis. Unconscious processes, for example, as we currently understand them have absolutely no connection to the kind of ideas the psychoanalysts have about the unconscious. 

There's a good article on the history of the unconscious here (unfortunately behind a paywall): [Fechner as a pioneering theorist of unconscious cognition](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012000050). Some relevant excerpts:

&gt;The Fechnerian model of consciousness and unconsciousness was shown to be directly inherited from Herbart’s modular
conception of the mind. Taken together, Herbart and Fechner appear to be the supporters of what I called elsewhere ‘‘the
theory of the fragmentation of consciousness’’ (Romand, 2005; Romand &amp; Tchougounnikov, 2008). This theory was not
the only scientific model of consciousness and unconsciousness of this period. It evolved in parallel with another tradition
of research, the so-called ‘‘ontogenetic theory of consciousness’’ that was elaborated by German psychologists between
about 1830 and 1870 (Romand, 2005; Romand &amp; Tchougounnikov, 2008). These two traditions of research must be regarded
as the origin of all other theoretical models of unconscious cognition until the beginning of the 20th century (Bleuler, 1905,
1913, 1920; Cornelius, 1897; Wundt, 1908–11), as well as the starting point of experimental investigations on unconscious
perception that developed in Germany and the United States as from the late 19th century (Dunlap, 1900; Jerusalem, 1894;
Pierce &amp; Jastrow, 1884; Sidis, 1898, chap. 17). The aim of this paper was not only to revisit the place of Fechner in the scientific
history of the unconscious, but also to show that the program of research on unconscious cognition is much older than
one usually pretends and does not result from the experimental investigations on blindsight as from the beginning of the
1970s (Stoerig &amp; Cowey, 1997; Weiskrantz, 1986). More generally speaking, it seems to me crucial to revise the history of
the unconscious, and notably to rule out this popular misconception that the Freudian unconscious is a foreshadowing of
modern studies on the cognitive unconscious (Buser, 2005; Naccache, 2006). As a matter of fact, the cognitive unconscious
is a program of research that has evolved autonomously since the beginning of the 19th century and that does not have much
to do with Freud’s and others’ metaphysical conceptions of the unconscious.2

and

&gt;Nevertheless, this does not mean that one should consider Freud and psychoanalysis as being the actual pioneers of the
‘‘new unconscious’’, on the grounds that the psychoanalytical unconscious transitorily dominated the theoretical debate in
the decades preceding its emergence. Psychoanalysis has been recognized for a long time to be a pseudoscientific form of
knowledge (Bühler, 1927; Cioffi, 1998; Popper, 1963), and the psychoanalytical unconscious clearly belongs to the ‘‘metaphysical’’
tradition of the unconscious which started to flourish at the beginning of 19th century (Schelling, 1797/1988;
Schopenhauer, 1859/1969; Hartmann, 1874/1893). In addition to being refractory to experimental approaches, Freud’s
and followers’ holistic and essentialist view of the unconscious appears to be theoretically incompatible with the conception
of the unconscious developed by cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists. Moreover, unlike the 19th century program of
research on unconscious cognition, it is impossible to draw accurate conceptual genealogies between psychoanalytical and
neurocognitive studies on the unconscious. In any case, contrary to what some authors pretend (Buser, 2005; Naccache,
2006), nothing allows us to maintain that Freud and psychoanalysis played any role in the rise of the current program of
research on unconscious cognition (Romand, 2005).

Basically, the vast majority of the history of unconscious and all of the current research exists entirely independently of any psychoanalytic contributions. The fields of psychology and neuroscience even attempted to shift their terminology from ""unconscious processes"" to ""automatic processes"" in order to avoid the connotations to the psychoanalytic view of the unconscious.

"'What do you do?' should always be a question relating to a specific stimulus, not a general description.

'The goblin lunges for you, dagger drawn. What do you do?' gives you a clear frame of reference to shape your answer.

'You're on the river, what do you do?' is just a dumb question.

As really are random encounters. At least, REALLY random encounters. Like, you roll on a table. And the table is some degree of CR appropriate fight. That's literally a time sink. If it were a video game we'd call it padding out the play time.

Encounters on the road can be interesting but they need to tell a story. A table, if you use one, should either be to help you pick from a list of interesting scenarios with a story to tell because you have a good stock of them and can't decide which to deploy, or an inspiration point ('a dozen goblins ransacking a deserted caravan' for example, can be the jumping off point for a mini-dungeon and resolving the local problem of goblins you just learned about.)

Criticising is easy, doing is hard, and teaching by example is best. So if he's sensitive about being talked to then the best thing to do is show him how its done.

Volunteer to run a short game to give him a break and a chance to play. Make it an adventure about getting to somewhere, take a half dozen one-off encounters, expand them into short adventures and then assign them to a table. Roll on the table, take out the appropriate 'interesting adventure lead' and run it. Cross it off the table and roll again the next time.

By showing him what 'random encounters on the road' can be, he will have a frame of reference for how to handle them (i.e. a little less random, a little more encounter)",RaygunCourtesan,1512432087,DnD

"Sucker Punch/Focus Blast is the easiest moveset, followed by Hex/Focus Blast, on Gengar. I can say this from my personal experience and experience of other similar players. My best time has been set against a SP/FB Gengar, using a team of maxed psychics and 2 legacy Gengar (yes, in case you didn't know, Gengar is SE against Gengar)! The best part of using Gengar in this match-up is that triple resistance to Focus Blast, so if you have more than half your health left, you can still tank a Focus Blast from the raid boss. If you were using Tyranitar, Gyarados and Rhydon vs FB Gengar, that really slows you down with lots of dodging and Gyarados's slow DPS. [Here is my fastest time on Sucker Punch/Focus Blast Gengar](https://youtu.be/zDvIES1cEFM), showing how easy it is with the right counters. In fact, I believe the world record for Gengar right now is with this exact moveset, with 4 Confusion/Shadow Ball Mewtwo, with a whopping 78 seconds left!!

My first Focus Blast Gengar scared me so I went with 2 Confusion/Future Sight Espeon, 2 Bite/Crunch Gyarados and 1 SC/SB Gengar (none of them barring the first Espeon were maxed at the time). I finished it with 12 seconds left, which was, back then, my best margin at a Gengar solo, and that greatly surprised me. Over time, I got better at it, and improved my SP/FB takedown time to 27 seconds, using only level 30 psychics! PC/FS Alakazam did fantastic there because of PC's easy dodgability and higher EPS.

So yes, Focus Blast Gengar is the easiest, and after that, I would say Sludge Bomb, then Shadow Ball is the hardest. Shadow Ball one-shots your psychic types even if they are maxed, and using a Gengar vs SB Gengar is suicidal unless you dodge well (even then, it's highly risky). Using multiple Bite/Crunch Tyranitar is the way to go in that match-up.

"Oh, it's possible possible, just not what you should expect when attempting a run like that. 

Even using the same setup, there's still plenty of variables that can easily swing the actual gain by a few hundred: how clustered all the spawns are, the rooms you get, monster swarms, ladder spawns. 

The bulk of the time is just spent in spamming down far enough. Once you're there, (and ""there"" is different for every person) getting several spiral rooms or mine cart tunnel rooms or monster levels can cut down on your gain by a fair amount, even if you still have extra stone to make stairs. Bad grouping of the spawns (although there are lots of spawns) will also reduce it significantly. Having to place 12 bombs instead of 6, while not a lot of time investment, cuts back overall.

Monsters should be ignored, but that can be tough if you're being swarmed by dragons, and a lot of these types of runs recommend not taking a weapon at all, which I think is just silly for this reason.  Once you start bombing, ladder location slightly matters too. If it's tied to one of the few nodes that are out away in a corner where you aren't collecting, you'll have to make your own. Run out of spare stone and now you're wasting a bomb + time to get 1 or 2 nodes just to find a way down. 

To fully optimize the run, there's several others tricks that are needed as well. Eating food after you've placed a few bombs pauses game time but still allows the bomb timers to count down is one of those, which also means you'll need hundreds of food.

It's a run that works. You'll get way more ore than you'll ever need no matter what. You just shouldn't go in expecting to get 1,000 ore every time, and especially if you've never done a run like that before because, at least to hit the 1,000 mark, it does take a fair amount of optimization.

Frankly, too, it's all a bit silly. Assuming you are buying all the supplies you need, the investment is well over 1,000,000 gold -- the stone alone is nearly 800,000. If you have that much money to spare for an iridium run, then you're already at a point where the iridium is useless.

The better runs are the ones you can do earlier, when you actually need the iridium and are vastly cheaper, but they won't net you anywhere near 1,000 ore. ",PM_YOUR_ISSUES,1512432090,StardewValley

"The security of a blockchain is proportional to the hash power devoted to maintaining that blockchain.  Bitcoin as a token served to provide financial incentive for entities to commit hashpower to the chain. 

To use blockchain tech without using Bitcoin you need to contribute a ludicrous amount of hashpower to maintaining that chain.  You either have to fund all that hashpower yourself (ridiculously expensive) or you have to provide your own token incentive for others to do so. There's already a ton of altcoins with slight differences, Bitcoin is still king, and it's king for a reason. 

You can build a layered tech that makes use of the existing Bitcoin blockchain to maintain your ledger, or you can attempt to establish your own blockchain.  The latter is much harder, much more expensive, and more vulnerable than the former. ",Alame,1512432093,canada

"I go through this too. I'd say many if not all kids raised by n's experience this. Loneliness and isolation (which both come from n-abuse) has already been proven to lead to narcissistic thinking. I guess as a coping mechanism because we have no one else to rely on but ourselves, so we start trusting ourselves too much.

 For me I struggle with 'Just because I think it's right, must mean it's right and that there are no other options'. It's a struggle because you don't want to contantly question if you're right (a symptom of gaslighting) but you don't want to be a know-it-all or think you have everything figured out because life will sorely prove you wrong. I've been thinking that having more friends and being introduced to more different worldviews than just the ones I know would help that. I know it's stupid but Tumblr really helped me with that. I used to be hardcore conservative and close-minded. But I was taught very quickly why I was wrong, and being introduced to so many different experiences and worldviews always helps me grow intellectually. I've learned to accept that I don't know it all, but to look at other people's stories and experiences, and deduce from that. 

Like with NPD, I came across a post about it and wasn't sure if my mom had it or not. Then coming on here I was proven right, just because she shared so many of the obscure traits and reacts exactly how narcs react to certain things (greyrocking). But speaking and interacting with people is one of the most important things that opened my eyes to actual reality rather than just my own thoughts by my own self.

"*Late to the party, but here we go...*

Oh, Mindy-Jane Cindy Blaine Lindsey McCrea, 

Was a terribly talented lass,

An inventor, who’d enter her shop every day,

Ponytail, with hairband, held fast.

It was there that she’d tinker. A brilliant thinker 
She was, blessed with brains filled right up to the brink; her
astounding IQ – at least one-forty-two  – 
Put her right at the top of her class.

   ‍   

The pride and the joy of her long-deceased father,

Who always did call her the ideal daughter,

She’d stand at her workbench and hammer and solder

Things that would make Edison’s eyes start to water. 

   ‍   

There was only one problem though, I must admit

(But she never did like to be told). 

I’ll explain: Never mind all her knowledge and wit,

Her attention was that of a fish coloured gold.

   ‍   

Though genius she was, her focus was null.

And ‘twas really quite tragic, you know.

For she’d pour all her heart into making a start,

But for just 30 minutes or so.

   ‍   

For instance, she once had a foolproof plan

To eliminate hunger for good,

With a series of pipes, each with 10-acre spans,

To pump synthesized food just as fast as they could

Into warzones and shelters, ‘twould zip helter-skelter

Through cities and small neighbourhoods.

And she made it her stint, and she sketched out a print,

And was drawing and sawing some wood,

When a half-hour in, she assumed a big grin,

An idea crept into her head. 

Dust still hovering among her,

She said “Forget hunger,

I think I’ll cure cancer instead!”

   ‍   

Poor old Mindy was clever, but still she could never

Hold onto a contract or deal. 

Every chance would fly past her,

Each person who asked for

Her service would see the plan keel. 

Business owners and pastors and circus ringmasters 

Requesting machines to bathe seals

Would hear of her fame, rush to look up her name, call her lame when her vice was revealed. 

   ‍   

Well this went on for years ‘fore she broke into tears

After several beers at the bar. 

(I had taken her out when I heard of her doubt,

Plus I owed her for fixing my car.)

   ‍   

“Listen, Mindy,” I said, “you’ve a brilliant head

Full of thoughts to compete with the best.

But you know and I know that wherever you go, 

Sticking with it puts you to the test.”

   ‍   

And she bawled, “Yes, it’s true! What’s a woman to do

With attention span short as a stick?”

Well, I took a small swig and I tried to think big, 

When, *Eureka!* The answer did click. 

   ‍   

“Didn’t you,” I began, with a wave of my hand, 

“find success in repairing my Kia?”

And she nodded, “So what? It was only the clutch.

Took 10 minutes.” “Well, there’s my idea…”

   ‍   


And throughout the duration of my explanation, 

Her frown turned around to a smile. 

When I’d outlined my plan, she extended her hand,

And I shook it. The date was worthwhile. 

   ‍   

Now Mindy-Jane Cindy Blaine Lindsey McCrea 

is a woman of wealth and success,

And her shop bears a large neon sign, which proclaims:

TURN-OVER TIME: 30 OR LESS.

   ‍

"Okay, so you want to save ""some"" horses while also making a living for yourself.  I am playing pretend here, with made-up numbers and so course you will be happy living a nice, middle-class life out there in Greater Rednecklandia on 40K a year (LOLOL) while buying your own healthcare.  

Luckily for you, you have inherited a 120 acre farm with dilapidated farmhouse and semi-functional bank barn to use for your facility.  It has some fenced pasture and some hayfields that need about 10K worth of lime put on them.  You don't have that money, though, so you muddle along without the lime even though it makes the productivity of your hayfields crappy.    

Real estate taxes for this property (due to Clean and Green arable land exemption) are around $3000 a year for property and school combined.  But, you inherited it free and clear, so there's no mortgage.  Yay!  You have electric bills, but no water/sewer because you have a well and septic that is currently working ok.  In year 6 of your simulated enterprise, the septic is going to go tits-up and you'll need to redo it with a sand mound to match current regs.  That'll be 20K but you won't see it coming.  You also inherited two functional John Deere tractors, one from 1968 (the ""new"" one) and one from 1950 (the ""old"" one).  They both mostly work as long as you keep pouring hydraulic fluid into them and they're paid for.  You have an elderly round baler that needs about $400 of work every season to keep it functional.  You have a fairly new mower with tedder that you paid 10K for and have paid off.  It runs great.  You have a very new rake that you paid 8K for and you still owe on that.  It's financed at 6%, but that's your only ongoing payment related to the farm.  You have an elderly F250 and a 3-horse slant that you can use to haul stock.  Oh, and your brother has a backhoe and the ability to dispose of horse corpses up over the hill beyond the pear tree.  (Any similarity to this set-up and a set-up that I know personally and intimately is PURELY COINCIDENTAL.)

Now, SAVEOLDPONIES.ORG (or whatever) is going to run off of What You Raise - 40K for Yourself.  You'll also need to file for 503c status and probably you'll have to hire an accountant to help you at tax time.

Differentiating yourself from other rescues.  There are a lot of deserving rescues out there.  You will need to market yourself and differentiate yourself from the field at large.  In short, what's your schtick and why should I give you my ""horse rescue dollars"" instead of throwing them at, say, BOBBY JO'S BACKYARD RESCUE or THE HAPPY TRAILS RETIREMENT RESCUE or KINDLY DRAFTS ARE NOT FOR EATING or any of the other excellent (pretend) nonprofits out there dedicated to Saving Horses From Slaughter?

Do you specialize in a given breed?  Are you a no-kill facility?  Do you have close ties with the local pony club, 4H, or hunt?  Is your deal that we-the-internet can band together and kickstarter one horse at a time in much the same way that people can SPONSOR A CHILD IN THE THIRD WORLD?  Do we get pix and updates on how our pensioner is doing?  (OOh, that sounds like fun.  And why should I do it with you and SAVEOLDPONIES.ORG when I can do it with RESCUEDOWNTHEROAD, a very nice organization with good people who rescue-retrain-and-rehome horses who've wound up at slaughter barns.  If I take my horse-rescue dollars to RDTR, I can visit my rescue horse IN PERSON and feed him apples and carrots and pet him and lead him around and stuff.)

Is it ethically OK for you to have a ""war chest"" for unforeseen expenses, or should pretty much every penny of what you raise go to feed the ponies once your own bill is covered?  (Hint:  you need a war chest.  Unexpected expenses happen all the time.  The wind came up and blew the roof off your elderly barn.  Your tractor needs new hydraulic cylinders.  Your baler needs all the belts replaced.)

What do you do when your monthly bill for the rescue horses runs about $700 a month and your fundraising, which was pretty good there for a while, has dwindled to bringing in about $300 a month?  I know you think you're going to have all the money for the entire life of the rescued horse sitting in the bank waiting for Ol' Red to live out his days, but in reality it is not going to work like that.  Ol' Red will live to be forty-five when you'd planned on 28.  And he'll eat everything in sight.  Rescue horses have a tendency to linger on and on and on, particularly when they are completely useless and cannot have any sort of a job.

Do you have the stomach to put up a picture of Roan Cindy and threaten your kickstarters to kill her if the money doesn't start coming in?  ""I rescued her on the strength of your donations and I'd planned for ten years at $HayPrice but we've had three years of drought and now round bales are going for $HayPrice + $20.00 and I don't have the money to pay the hay man and WINTER IS COMING.  DON'T LET THE REAPER TAKE ROAN CINDY!!!!  Your $$$ Matter!  Save A Life!!!""  (If you think this sort of shit ""never happens"" to rescues, you had better spend some freaking time googling horse rescue operations.  It happens ALL THE TIME.)

It sounds to me like you want to convince the internet to band together and retire worthless horses that they don't know from adam so that you don't have to deal with actual bitchy in-person clients who are paying for the retirement of their personal horses that they give two shits about.  

Were I a less-kind person, perhaps one who'd been doing rather a lot of recent reading about Victorian Baby Farming, I might accuse you of kickstartering to ""rescue and retire"" horses that are then found to ""have navicular"" and need to be put down.  Or they ""have heaves so bad they can barely breathe"" and need to be put down.  Or they colic and die due to heavy parasite load.  Unlike a locally-funded and in-person rescue, doing a kickstarter so that you're a few removes away from the donations makes it A LOT harder for anyone to determine whether or not the attrition is excessive or just ""bad luck"" due to trying to save old, sick horses.  Good thing I'm not that sort of person, innit?",throwaway224,1512432098,Equestrian
"While I see your point, I think that's a bit of a false equivalency. Letting people visit your several vast properties with attractions does not seem the same as sharing your car with the community.

Don't get me wrong, I can understand the desire to be the only one who can access a beautiful place. I just feel like it is an action that lacks compassion and your surprise that others would think they 'deserve' to visit it seems rooted in feelings of superiority.

"Mhm. 1 offhanded remark vs starting a lengthy discussion about said offhand remark. I've seen the error of my ways. Unlike you, I care nothing about facts and stats. I was wrong all along. 

I simply said you were arguing on behalf of Leffen. Never even said that was a bad thing. Not going to go over AGAIN why I said this. You got extremely defensive for some reason, and entirely diverted the discussion away from what we were originally talking about. I'm definitely the petty one here. I defended myself when accused of lying, and repeatedly insulted. You defended yourself because when you had an argument refuting Plup&gt;Leffen, I said you're arguing on behalf of Leffen. By the way, claiming that ""the gap isn't as definitive as (I) make it out to be"" IS arguing on behalf of Leffen. You're saying he's closer to Plup than I made it out to be. Explain to me how that is in no way an argument in behalf of Leffen. You may not be saying he's actually over Plup, but you are saying it's closer than I say. But go on, tell me all about my ""extremely blatant strawman."" 

Actually, count my comment about you arguing on behalf of Leffen as an insult. Remember, it was only 1 part of my post(s). I also reaffirmed my own stance, and someone else supported me as well. Sounds like I was insulting you because you were wrong, and I explained why you're wrong. Should be perfectly okay in your book.

Or, would you rather I divert the discussion towards refuting your claim that I'm a moron?

&amp;nbsp;

Main character ~~touma especially~~ seemingly not paying attention ends up in the women's restroom/changing room where they promptly beat the crap out of him for making an honest mistake. This breaks suspension of disbelief.  Same version when the male character walks in on them changing into scantily clad outfits. I hate this trope so much. How about the accidental pervert where physics somehow revolves around this.Unrealistic ways of victory is a pretty bad one as well (SAO). Fanservice  is distracting especially if the characters are teenagers. Im nearing 19 and it tires me out. I can ignore these but they do get on my nerves. Power creep, At Least dbs is trying to mitigate this naruto imo was the most egregious usage of this trope. Useless females characters nuff said. Stupid or incompetent main character at times where they are slower that the audience to see a problem or they don't plan how they can win a fight. I don't mind this if it's a character flaw and something that they improve on later on but in this cont.
&amp;nbsp;

**Western Cartoons**
&amp;nbsp;

The idiot father because this cliche has been done to death, Especially with examples like peter griffin. The status quo isn't a particularly hateable one of mine but it does reset the character development. Take a look at this scene in the [boondocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhn_TAbvSH8)(The best show ever made IMO.) Too bad after all of that character development riley is going to basically be reset as if this never happened. Random unintelegent humor aka TTG. The slapstick immune character, These characters  are limited because of their immunity to slapstick. Especially if they are insufferable. The it's just for kids mindset is also cancer. Added : the annoying character that always screws with the main characters for some sort of arbitrary objective( Johnny test, dee dee from dexter's lab and candace phineas and Ferb). The get out of jail free card This trope is noticeable in anime as well but this example always comes to mind. Legend of korra season 1 where she lost her bending but 
Aang somehow appeared and restored it. It would have had much more potential as a story if korra's bending  stayed gone until she earned the abilities back. Oh yeah would could I forget this [trope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XC4vIBZkRSk) and knuckles deconstructing it. The butt monkey a character that is abused constantly, This trope can be done well if the character is legitimately unlikeable or made unlikable. However when its someone who doesn't deserve it it gets on my nerves.
&amp;nbsp;

**Movies**
&amp;nbsp;

Ancient artifact that will be relevant to the plot even if the previous movies never mentioned anything of the sort cliche. Basically the entire transformers thing. That absolute character assassination or glossed over plot elements through adaptations(Percy jackson and the olympians and Fan4stic). A comedy using all of their best jokes in the trailers. It's also the icing on the cake if it has stock music. Product placement, breaks immersion.
&amp;nbsp;

**Video games**
&amp;nbsp;

Oh boy I think those count. Game never telling you about you not being able to use that character in the future due to a story element or something else(Fire emblem genealogy. This crap caused me countless resets thx quan and his wife.) Underdeveloped main storylines in a grand open RPG(Skyrim, fallout 4). FORCED LOSSES(I should make a beatrix rant.

"The best--if not only-- justification for boobplate is that it's worn to be performative rather than protective.

People create boobplate in media because some people of the target audience like that form of eye-candy, which, given the right sort of world, can also be true of the in-fiction armor.

I actally have two examples of this in popular media.

In one of the David Eddings books, a princess--I honestly forget which one--comissions armor that exaggerates her feminine form in a form of deliberate social engineering on her own troops: ""even our princess has taken up arms, we must keep fighting."" The armor is explicitly absolutely garbage for defense, it had to be made thinner and lighter on order for the young woman to walk about in it for as long as she needed to.

The other is Kings of the Wyld, where there is a very brief mention of what amounts to booth babes hired by showy mercenary companies to help hype up their fans after a successful job (it makes sense in context). This is used primarily to illustrate just how shallow the mercenary companies have become.

Note that neither of these cases are about titilation. The description of the  physical armor itself is maybe half a sentence. Instead the author focuses on the absurdity of the boobplate for humor, characterization, and worldbuilding.",AceOfFools,1512432100,fantasywriters

Zygarde is no longer a great team monster in the current meta, but he's one of the best support monsters, feature available after level 75, so this event would get you a long way towards having him. But its still going to be expensive to get him to full 100%, I'm not sure how many more cells you would need to get the full monster, but you need access to the VIP store to buy them, they cost 500 diamonds each.

"Hi, welcome to the game! Take a look at my [Beginner's Guide to Warframe.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ykmbone993qrqfg/WF%20Beginner%27s%20Guide%20v2.2.pdf?dl=0) It's a bit of a read, but I think you'll find it worthwhile, even if you might know some of it already; there's always more to learn in Warframe. Alternatively, here's a quicker summary of what all new players should know starting out:

1. **STARTING PLATINUM:** First and foremost, if you haven't already, spend your starting platinum (premium currency) on inventory slots, or perhaps Orokin Reactors/Catalysts (items that will increase the upgrade capacity of an item). This will allow you to expand your arsenal early, and inventory slots are the only essential progression item that *requires* plat. Later on, you can either choose to buy more plat (wait until you get a login reward discount), or down the road you'll build up a stack of more valuable items which you can sell to other players for plat.

2. **FARMING &amp; ACQUISITION:** NEVER BUY WARFRAMES, WEAPONS, RESOURCES, OR MOD PACKS WITH PLAT. All these things are easily acquired via farming, and you will never need plat to get them. Some things may seem like plat is the only option, but [look more closely at their store page.](http://i.imgur.com/vskQjhO.jpg) They will either have a crafting blueprint readily available or they will tell you where you can farm/acquire it (such as certain weapons which must be accessed from clan research). What you should use plat for (in my opinion) is inventory slots and cosmetics (colors, armor, helmets, etc), as well as occasionally buying rare items which are no longer available. Certain items were released as part of limited-time Events, but may still be traded between players. These items generally fetch higher prices, and while they aren't always needed they can give your builds or arsenal a nice boost.

3. **CONTENT AND THINGS TO DO:** Moving on, there's usually the question of ""I finished the tutorial... what now?"" There's plenty to do in Warframe. Your first priority should be completing the starchart. This means playing and unlocking every mission on every planet. You'll just follow the connecting lines; blinking blue missions have been unlocked but not yet completed. When you get to a junction (""mass relays"" connecting you to the next planet), you'll have to complete a series of tasks in order to unlock the junction and continue. Having all the missions and planets unlocked will give you freedom of access to everything, so you won't miss out on farming spots, timed alerts, or other events. Of course, as you progress to planets further away from the sun the missions and enemies will become more difficult. As you go, collect some new warframes (the game's character classes) and weapons to help you out (see point 4 in regards to this). Some frames I recommend getting early on in the game are Rhino (farmed from the Venus boss), Oberon (parts drop from any eximus enemies, which you can find anywhere but are more common on higher-level missions), or Frost (farmed from the Mars boss). Good starter weapons with low rank requirements are the Boltor, Hek, Lex, and Dual Kamas, among others. Always remember to try out as many things as possible; these are just suggestions. You can also complete quests as you get them (keep in mind that quests aren't like a primary campaign in most RPGs, but more like side stories that help add a bit of lore to the universe). Joining a syndicate (an NPC faction) will allow you to easily gain access to a variety of rewards like warframe ability augment mods, health/ammo/energy restore items, and more. 

4. **GETTING STRONGER:** A common misconception is that getting new weapons will magically make you more powerful (ie ""my weapon sucks, what's a better weapon?""). While this is somewhat true (for example, the Soma Prime is significantly better than the Mk-1 Braton), you won't see a huge jump between them without the proper mod setup. Mods are the core upgrade system of Warframe, and can be found in a variety of locations, mostly from enemies you kill. Their effects can range from simple damage upgrades, to more complicated enhancements. As far as *how* to mod, it's ultimately up to you, but here's an easy and surefire way to determine a good build (a setup of mods) for your weapon: there's two main stats you look at, status chance (the weapon's chance to cause a status effect such as burning, knockdown, etc) and critical chance (its percent chance to cause bonus damage). If you have 20% or more crit chance, give the weapon more mods that boost its critical chance/damage. Same thing for status chance. If it's not strong in either, just build it for straight damage. Some weapons require some additional thought (perhaps it reloads slowly so add reload speed mods, or its a beam weapon so its DPS will benefit from firerate mods, stuff like that). In the beginning, you won't need to worry about the ""perfect"" build as you'll still be collecting mods and won't have everything you need to get truly creative for some time, but always try to play to the weapon or warframe's strong aspects.

5. **EARNING EXPERIENCE (""AFFINITY""):** When it comes to leveling up your gear, it's important to know how exp is awarded. The following shows the most basic splits of exp-- killing something with your warframe powers will give 100% of the exp to your frame (regardless of whether it's max rank); killing something with your gun will give 50% of the exp to your frame and 50% to the killing gun; any other shared exp (such as your teammates' kills) will give a flat 25% of the exp to your frame, and the remaining 75% is split evenly between all equipped weapons (if all 3 weapons are equipped they each get 25%, if 2 weapons are equipped they each get 37.5%, and if only 1 weapon is equipped it will get all 75%). You don't necessarily have to memorize this, but it's good to keep in mind in case you want to level something quicker, or wondering why your gear might not be getting exp very fast.

6. **MASTERY RANK:** Gaining mastery rank is something that confuses a lot of people. MR is essentially the overall rank of your account, which is separate from the rank of your warframe (think of your frame as just another weapon in your arsenal). You earn mastery points for each unique item you level to max rank, the first time. To advance your MR, you'll need to craft and level *new* weapons and frames, as leveling the same ones again will not give you more mastery. The maximum mastery rank possible is determined the number of unique items in the game (3000 mastery per weapon, 6000 mastery each for frames and companions). You will need a higher mastery to unlock certain weapons and locations, as well as other benefits, such as increasing the minimum mod capacity on an unranked weapon. Even if a weapon has poor damage, or you just don't like it for whatever reason, you should always level it to rank 30 before discarding it, so you retain the mastery points for it. Your mastery points are permanent, but if you craft the same weapon again, it won't be the same weapon-- you'll have to start it again from rank 0 (once again though, doing this will not grant you more mastery). One last thing to keep in about how mastery works is that because its a static amount determined by the total number of items in the game, you store all the mastery you earn, even if you've already hit the amount needed to rank up. If you go over the required amount before performing the rank up test, your overflow will be waiting for you on the other side.

7. **ADDITIONAL TIPS:** 

- Along the lines of etiquette, something I see a lot of new players do is force-start the mission when not everyone has voted to begin (usually in private squads). It's generally best to avoid this feature, as people will ready-up when they're ready, and if they haven't it's most likely because they're still selecting weapons, or maybe changing their mods.

The other part is that I don’t trust her and that DH’s niece is spoilt rotten and we want our children to value hardwork, understanding the difference between want and need and earning their pocket money, doing chores etc. When DH and I started dating SIL used to borrow money off him to buy niece the latest craze or gadget because she “needed it” or “had to have it”. After DH was discussing with me how he didn’t think he could cover the rego for his car cause he had loaned his sister money for said gadget and still hadn’t been paid back yet, months later, I asked him how often this happened and he said fairly often. If SIL couldn’t get the money from their parents, she’d go to him and emotionally manipulate him into giving her money.

"Previously, the Apple TV 4K would always output in 60Hz and HDR (Dolby Vision) no matter what content was played.

This was problematic in two cases:

* When the content was 24 FPS, forcing it to output at 60Hz created slight jittering. Because of the fact 60 isn't a multiple of 24, some frames got displayed for longer than others when they shouldn't. The effect is subtle but not ideal.

* When content was SDR (not HDR), it got ""upscaled"" to HDR before getting output. This distorted colors, generally increasing contrast and saturation in an undesirable way. This was more because of a technical constraint than Apple thinking it looked better that way.

Now, the Apple TV 4K gains both the ability to output 24 FPS content at 24Hz, and the ability to output SDR content in SDR. Both are done dynamically, meaning if you go back to the home screen, it'll output back to 60Hz HDR again.

Those two changes are *not* related to the fact modern TVs often do ""motion smoothing"" by default. Motion smoothing is your TV interpolating your output to add ""fake"" frames in an attempt to make everything look like it has a higher frame rate than it really does (generally faking 120 FPS).

"As creatures of subjectivity we are occurring tangentially to objective reality, creating our perspective as we live. Omnijectivity is an attempt to label the phenomenon of subjectivity establishing its mutually benefiting configurations. Objectivity could be argued to be just, away, from us, and so what we have to work with is the effective bonds between us subjects.

The more that one highlights the meta physicality of reality at large the more unified one will find collective culture. The act of directing awareness to the structure behind the world will allow us to become accustomed and assimilated into the state of totality, of oneness. Subjective consciousness is finding its way into infinite recursion, and the results will be literally mind blowing. By lending more and more power and potential to our conscious agency, we ascend cognitively.

If we kept our exchanges simple and succinct we'd likely learn a great deal from one another. The ability to learn is omnipresent, one who learns to learn will possess the world in the palm of their hands. By keeping knowledge and information at an arms reach, the powers that be maintain their illusory position of power. This here internet augmented my brainpower and forever altered my consciousness. 

Being able to exchange thoughts and construct metaphysical locations is ridiculously over powered, our present generations are going to be incredible. It's no wonder that human greed is coming into play again. If we don't establish the internet as a basic human right, we'll be locking out our very potential.

"To this day I still cannot figure out how to reliably 3rd stage boost. I know how it works and how you engage it but it’s so bloody touchy and it’s such a fine touch to get it to work that it was usually only a fluke for me. 2nd stage boost is relatively easy since it just involves circumventing the quick boost cooldown by rapidly alternating between two directions of boosting (usually is one forward boost, a sideways boost, and forward again, which can be chained with a sideways boost in the other direction and forward again, which means you can rapidly quick boost five times without waiting for the cooldown). 

3rd stage boosting is when you more smoothly pull the quick boost trigger to the engagement threshold and then pull the rest of the way to get a much more powerful boost. I could do it in practice doing it slowly, but the guys online were rapidly 3rd stage boosting in combination with 2nd stage boosting. I don’t know how the fuck they were doing it. I just gave up.

2. This one may be too brutally honest: I'm kind of put off by the Amazon links, especially on the Ghost Map page.

"There's some people in apologetics circles like [CARM](https://carm.org/questions/about-demons/was-lucifer-originally-angel-worship) I think who try to explain in which way Lucifer is in fact Satan, and how the scriptures make the implication for anyone who's paying careful attention.

There are some people who would argue with you that the equivocation between Lucifer and Satan are not based in scripture and are more like a Christian tradition (like a cultural tradition, if you will) popularized by works like Paradise Lost.

It's not at all a stretch to assert that a great deal of Christians do not actually read the Bible, or do not actually fully understand the history that led to the articles and nuances of the faith which they so take for granted. So in the same sense that people all across the world are *inculcated* - i.e. born into and raised in - particular cultures with their respective assumptions and beliefs, and the pressure to take those nuances as holy writ, people come to just get a general idea that Lucifer == Satan.

And of course the funny part is a lot of people actually adopt *that* idea that Lucifer is Satan as an expression of rebellion; i.e. your stereotypical teenaged Satanists/Luciferians, what have you, etc.

I really didn't have much to do with my time initially and although I think ""addicted"" is the wrong word for it, I started spending WAY too much time and money on the sites. Initially, it was fun for me and I was convinced I was getting amazing deals. I liked waiting on packages to arrive and when you don't have a job or a ton of things to occupy your day, it's surprising (and sad) what you end up looking forward to.

After awhile though, I started to notice my closet was getting packed, uncomfortably so. I also started having thoughts in the back of my mind-- ""$40 for a shirt might be a great deal but... you're still spending at least $40 almost every day""; lemme tell ya, it really DOES add up. I couldn't possibly wear everything I got enough to justify purchasing it and the ""sales"" started to stress me out; they felt endless, like a black hole of shoes and clothes. I wasn't having much fun anymore and I also started thinking, ""Why did I even buy this? Do I actually like it or was it because I thought it was a good deal?""

I remember one day adding things to my cart and thinking to myself, ""I can't stop."" But my immediate next thought was, ""Wait, what are you talking about? Yes, you can. Just stop buying shit."" For me, I was lucky because it really was that easy for me; I know it isn't the same for everyone. It also occurred to me that if I really looked hard enough, there would ALWAYS be a sale somewhere and there would ALWAYS be something that I wanted. That isn't a sustainable life though, at least not for me. The constant action of getting stuff just to get it was making me feel gross and disgusted with myself.

Sarah reminds me of myself during that point in my life, but completely amplified. For me, the money was a deterrent enough but also the CLUTTER annoyed me. That's why when I see all those mugs, I just think, ""Wtf? Why would anyone want 50 mugs? THAT'S SO MUCH STUFF.""

Years later, most of the stuff I purchased, I've either donated or resold (I did get some amazing Helmut Lang pieces though, not parting with those) and I really do feel fortunate that I was able to stop shopping compulsively. Although I'm sure I spent a lot (not sure how much it was but I was never in any real financial danger, let bills slide, etc), I realized how easy it is to let something like that get out of hand. I hope she has similar thoughts soon-- like I said, spending like that isn't sustainable and there will ALWAYS be sales. You aren't getting bargains if you're buying stuff just to buy it!",EliseNoelle,1512432105,blogsnark

"Sorry for talking to myself here, but the gitter is also kind of a ghost town. I will just ask my questions here in the hopes someone happens by.

1) Is there any rate limiting / throttling of requests? I find it very difficult to find definitive answer on this. 

2) I sometimes have issues with getting errors back, and other times responses that are just missing the data, when I look at the website 'Status'page I always find it to be all green (100% up), I am wondering if this page is really accurate, and related to my above question, if it is then I don't know if only I am having issues because of some throttling in place. Nothing about the errors indicate that though, they are generally 504s.

I realize above may come off as complaining, really I don't mean it that way. Well aware I am not paying anything and entitled therefore to approximately no service level. I just want to right-size my expectations and find out if I am alone in having these issues and if they are because of some limit. I don't think I am sending an obnoxious number of requests, but to be sure I'd need to know the limits.

Tangent question related to that, if I were willing to pay something is there any tier of service that has less traffic than the free nodes or something like that? Affordable to an individual project, no deep ICO pockets here, but I do pay Amazon now and again.

Finally I have various questions about listening for events, I gather from some places I have read it is disabled, but there are other conflicting statements about it, so that is along the lines of something I'd like to chat with other folks about if there were such a place.

"I've actually been playing through the Ezio Trilogy lately, and just finished Revelations about two days ago. Finished AC 2 a few weeks back. The biggest thing I noticed with AC 2 in hindsight was how little mission variety there actually was. I remember when the game came out it was praised for being much more varied than the original (which I've never really played) but upon a replay you really are doing the same few things, just with a different wrapping. There are few to no ""set piece"" missions that really introduce a new mechanic. Furthermore, a lot of the new mechanics that are introduced, like poison and to a lesser extent the gun, are not really useful. You'll find reasons to use both but there isn't ever really a need to.

Brotherhood is where those mechanics really start to come into their own. The story is weaker, for sure, (though it starts strong, it kinda loses steam and rests of its laurels a bit too much), but the actual gameplay has a lot more variety. Combat is smoother, if easier, and you can use the gun as part of combos which really makes it a super useful tool. The poison blade gets the dart upgrade, which allows you to use it from afar, so it is marginally more useful, and calling in assassin's is a great way to feel badass and clear rooftops, even if actually recruiting and training them is pretty meh.

All that said, both games are really fun. I had a good time with AC 2, and I still think it's one of the best games in the series, and one of the best sequels ever made. If you've never played it, it's absolutely worth picking up and trying, but Brotherhood really was a better game in all aspects except for narrative and maybe setting.",Pugway,1512432107,pcmasterrace

**Maryland:** Anyone that saw last nights cluster fuck is going WTF!!!

* I agree Turgeon is a liability rather than an asset on the court...but he does a solid job of getting good players together and having them play the game. It is unfortunate but Turgeon may not have a bad enough season at Maryland to really warrant getting rid of him. Sorry Maryland.

* Maryland like Purdue had big shoes to fill...but filling a PG's shoes is a very difficult task. I do think Maryland's guards are getting there even though they are young and I think things will smooth out through the season. It is difficult to transition from having someone that you ALWAYS rely on to suddenly being one of the guys being relied on. It makes close games much shakier.


* I also think as Fernando gets games under his belt he will be able to contribute more and more, and eventually break into the starting line possibly this month, he has a lot of freshmen roughness, so there isn't REALLY a point in having him as a starter yet...but he is definitely getting there. I also think Maryland plays completely different when Fernando is on the court, and it is better. As he is able to increase his minutes Maryland will look better.


* The truly scary thing about Maryland though is they are pretty young, most of their production is from sophomores and freshmen. They will develop well through this year as they adjust to not having Melo there to pull them through rough games.  I think it is somewhat unfortunate Maryland ran into Purdue this early, but in other ways it was fortunate and I also think the disaster of a game against Illinois is similarly a good learning experience for them. They have a good easy December to get some of that roughness off the younger players and I think they will be pretty decent come January.


My guess is still Maryland finishing in 3rd in the B1G (behind MSU and Purdue, in particular with the Purdue loss) and just edging out Minnesota.",Icreatedthisforyou,1512432107,CollegeBasketball

" &gt; Oh god damn that last season. I hated all the God stuff on BSG. And maybe I'm naive but I would have loved if they'd reach earth to find it some star trek like society. Instead we got cavemen

The BSG remake will always have a special place in my heart because the show gave us so many great characters, but I would be kidding myself if I was making it out to be a perfect television series. The truth is, the show had many of the same flaws that are plaguing Arrow these days. The BSG writers had no long-term plan for the show and they were too scared to cut the cord on characters once they had overstayed their welcome. The most egregious example of this has got to be Gaius Baltar. James Callis was undoubtedly fantastic in the role, but the character really should have been gone after the trial storyline that culminated in the finale of season 3. However, the writers didn't have the guts to write him out, so they pulled a lame acquittal out of their asses and the character got to stick around for an additional season. As ridiculous as that ""twist"" was, I think I could have lived with it if it had lead to something truly great in season 4, but what did they end up giving us? A completely trite and boring harem storyline. As bad as the final season was overall, that particular story arc was definitely the bottom of the barrel in terms of quality storytelling.

"&gt;Suppose I wonder why I got sick, and someone says: ""it's because your co-worker Andy drank spoiled milk yesterday.""

This is not at all analogous to the situation we are talking about. Nor does it get any better as it goes.

&gt;Surely that reasoning is crazy. Our evidence is not just ""*someone or other* got sick"", but ""*I* got sick"". Likewise, our evidence is not ""*some universe or other* is life-permitting"", but ""*our* universe is life-permitting"".

Except the two cases are different. That's the very point you are missing. To even begin to get close to analogous, you would have to imagine an office where, very rarely, say one time out of a million, someone in your office gets sick, but you can only know if someone is sick (or that there is even such a thing as sickness)  if the person who gets sick is you, and you can't even be certain that you have any coworkers.

You get sick. 

Now, if you imagine that you work for a company with a million employees, this isn't a surprising outcome. Someone was likely to get sick, even with such low odds, with that many people. And since only the person who happened to get sick would know that the sickness existed, the fact that it happened to be you is unfortunate, but to the extent that you know what sickness is, you had to be the one to fall ill. That is, it could have been anyone else, but then you wouldn't know disease even existed and whoever else got sick would be the one complaining about it on here. Your specific identity *doesn't matter*. 

But you might also be the company's only employee. It is possible, but less likely, because then it isn't about a random person who happens to be you getting sick, but about you personally getting sick. Now your specific identity matters very much, and the odds were very much against it happening. ",Rithense,1512432108,philosophy

&gt; At around 4:00 a.m. on September 12, the group launched a mortar attack against a CIA annex approximately one-mile away, killing CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and wounding ten others. 

&gt; There is no definitive evidence that al-Qaeda or any other international terrorist organization participated in the Benghazi attack.

What do you think happened? How does someone else attacking our embassy become Clinton ""hung fellow service men out to dry in Benghazi"". 

Because as far as I can tell none of the people injured or killed were in the US military. ",kodemage,1512432108,GirlGamers

"Not to be that guy but this is different opinions. 

I'll explain my way of thinking and buckle up because its a bit a read (apolpgies in advance!):

If you practice your blink its amazing in PvE and PvP. Im so pro with it I use it all the time. I usually beat gaurdians using glide, double jump or lift on platform challenges. The trick is to practice until you have an internal timer for your blink charges, that way you are never caught without a blink charge. Honestly, try using nothing but blink for a bit and eventually you will see where I'm coming from.

Gaurdian needs revived? Blink to the respawn, as soon as they are revived blink out the way of the fire. Doing this you can pull off reviving gaurdians in the most horrendous situations.

Blink also confuses the AI sometimes. Brackion spamming slap rifle shots at you? Timing your blink will make every shot miss you, this applies to any AI.

Blink increases your displacement massively. You can outrun anyone with blink, even if they have Mida equipped. True story.

Blink is also extremely useful for teleporting behind and out of cover. I don't need to explain the advantages of that though.

Also, pair a sword with the ability to instantly jump forward a few meters and you have something unstoppable there sir. And this leads me to my next point...

Arc soul is great when your team uses it. Yes it boosts over all dps and yes it allows for some unique defensive strategies. But I raise you devour when combined with a sword and blink.

For example, absorb your grenade to activate devour, equip your sword and then lunge right into the middle of hordes of enemies. (picture the heroic event where vex are ""building something"" but you are handling the waves solo.) Swing your sword constantly. A sword is usually 1-2 hit kill so each time you swing that sword your devour is reset and health replenished to full. If you come across a yellow bar, you upercut and you will gain 5 ammo, replenishing the ammo you used to uppercut and resetting your devour and replenishing your health. You can do this until all your ammo is depleted and you won't die. Ever. With enough yellow bars dropping heavy ammo you can do this indefinitely. And guess what? If you mess up and are about to die, you can blink right back out of dangers way. 

A stormcaller in this situation would only be able to handle so many adds before being completely overrun. And if you mess up and get hurt, you can try glide but you won't get away fast enough. Even with arc soul your best chance is to bring down a few red bars with you.

Now imagine the sword wielding warlock with Nez Sin equipped too. You can actually regen your super, grenade, rift and melee energy at the entrance to the pyramidion on the Brackion strike with this build. 

To put it in perspective, on a strike I typically manage 150 kills and I usually generate ~16-21 orbs over 4 or 5 supers every strike and never die once. I'm also the guy who gets to a downed gaurdian to revive them before anyone else is even close to them.

That was a long read but you put me into a somewhat defensive mood over my blink and devour haha - it's my (arc) soul man!

What's your stormcaller strategies? Interested to learn from a stormcaller devote :)

"I generally agree ... I see it partially as a community issue and partially as an Niantic issue.  
On one hand, communities have to reach out and form connections with new agents as soon as ""Agent x has completed training/captured their first portal/made their first link/etc"" and start getting them involved ... but I've seen so many agents start, play a bit, get contacted, and then disappear.  
That's where it starts to be a Niantic problem - the very initial hump where you're learning how to walk and making contact with your local community could be loads better. Once that's done it's a fairly quick grind to A8, especially if you get involved locally right away.

This of course, mostly applies to random people signing up solo - if you already have friends that play, or that can help get you on board, you have an inherit advantage, and you're probably going to stick around.",hansolo669,1512432112,Ingress

Okay, thanks. The imperfect and perfect are an aspect contrast. The pluperfect is a tense that reflects a state of affairs anterior to some past state of affairs.

""I don’t really know about the three-way aspect. Never heard anything about it. But I googled and the three aspects are progressive, perfect and simple, right?""

Basically, yes. English has the progressive, the habitual and the perfect, if by that we mean present reference to a past act with effect lasting until the present. The past and future add a punctual aspect not available in the present, so actually that's four aspectual differences.

&gt; Molly Bloom, a beautiful young Olympic-class skier, ran the world's most exclusive high-stakes poker game for a decade before being arrested in the middle of the night by 17 FBI agents wielding automatic weapons. Her players included Hollywood royalty, sports stars, business titans, and finally, unbeknownst to her, the Russian mob. Her only ally was her criminal defense lawyer Charlie Jaffey, who learned that there was much more to Molly than the tabloids led us to believe.

2. Thanks Obama, trump hasn't done anything to affect the economy yet, he inherited a sound economy from Obama. In the next year you will start to see the damage from tRump.

3. Thanks Obama, unemployment has been declining for years thanks to Obama. Trump the Chump will reverse that given time.
 
4. LMAO, you ignorant taint warts have been ranting that for years. Newsflash cuck....Hillary isn't under investigation. Manafort, Flynn, Page, Papadopulous, Kushner, tRump Jr., Flynn Jr., Cohen, etc. ARE!  Those are the traitors and Flynn was only the first domino to fall. Mueller won't be able to shut those bitches up when they start looking at prison time.

5. The Oil and Gas industries survive on corporate welfare and subsidies from tax dollars. If you ever get a job and pay taxes you'll be subsidizing it too(if you're an American). tRump promised to bring the coal industry back. LMAO. Renewables are the future. Oil and Gas is on their last legs like the tobacco industry in the 80's.

"The Japanese mindset towards becoming a regional power,began in 1852 when Commodire Perry sailed into Tokyo Bay. Japan's desire to avoid the fate of the Chinese animated much of their foreign policy. I'm in no way excusing the abuses of Imperial Japan in saying this simply addressing the notion that eighty years of anxiety could be repealed with outside interference from the U.S. Western involvement in Japanese affairs is what helped to spur Japan's colonial mindset in the first place. If American and European colonialist accepted a limited Japanese sphere of influence in the early 1900's it may have allayed certain fears which in part contributed to violent proactive measures taken by Japan but I don't see that happening.",SergeantDamon,1512432119,AlternateHistory

"&gt; What's ANO's position on NATO/Russia?

Generally pro-NATO, they had a defense minister in the past government that held the general pro-Western line and who is about to become the new foreign affairs minister in the new government.

Babiš himself has not been very outspoken about NATO or Russia though, he didn't seem to care about foreign affairs much when he was the finance minister in the previous government and ANO basically is a party with no fixed ideology, so we don't really know what to expect from him.

On one hand, he's a pragmatic person and he realizes that the general pro-Western orientation is economically good not just for the country, but also for him and his businesses, on the other hand, his minority government might end up relying on the support of communists and far-right euroscepticts, because no one else wants to cooperate with him.

"10/10 and 10/10? 

What? 

No hate, but even tho he's really good, don't get me wrong, he's very far from a 10/10. If you consider a 10/10 as in the strongest captain in the game, then lucy would be a 10/10, mihawk is far from lucy.

As a sub? He's really really really niche, and even though strong, he really can't compare to adv mode mihawk, who is the real 10/10 slasher sub.

If I have to choose between mihawk subs, unless it's colo shiryu or some other fight that requires that special, advHawk will always be ten times better. I actually find myself never using 6+ mihawk because I have adv mihawk who just does so much more. The only times I actually use him is when I force myself to make a team with him, sacrificing 1 adv mode mihawk (still gonna use one as a friend), just because I have him and I really like using him. 

Also, neo mihawk can't really be considered hard content, and it can really easily be done without 6+ or even 6* mihawk (since we have a ftp adv mihawk who still nukes everyone and leaves mihawk with a tiny bit of health).

He's good, but far from a 10/10. 8.5/10 captain and 8/10 special IMO.  I think Legend zoro still has a better captain and his special makes it enough of a reason to use him as a captain instead of 6+hawk. Fujitora is the best slasher captain imo just for the absurd amount of damage, while I'd put adv hawk lower than mihawk as a captain because it's conditional (although I rarely find myself needing more than 2 turns of 2x orb boost and 2.75 chain lock with 2 3.5 flat captains), even though the possibility of using adventure mode mihawk's specal twice in a game really makes me wanna use him instead of inthawk.

So tl;dr, I think he's good, but if I'd have to build a slasher team, advhawk has the priority, which is enough of a reason to put 6+hawk out of the 10/10 realm

&gt;Are you implying that Roy's can't do the same? It definitely can.

No, I'm saying that not breaking CC against fastfallers at the same percent Roy's does  isn't as big of a deal as it might seem, because you can get the grab regardless unless they shine, and Fox can't really follow up on that against Mewtwo. So, at worst, it resets neutral. 


&gt;Please elaborate.

Roy's best options out of downtilt, to my understanding, are grab and side smash, Mewtwo's best options are more down tilts, grab, and DJC fair/upair. Both can uptilt to achieve effectively the same thing. 

More options is true in a technical sense because of the amount of stuff you can do as a result of having DJC, but I guess I wanted to say ""better options"" rather than more options. 

&gt;OK here you're getting way off topic lol. But I will add that Roy is also relatively good at juggling floaties above him, and his up throw is actually the second strongest in the game, so he can also use it to kill floaties (though not as early as Mewtwo can). Roy also can techchase with down and forward throws. But none of this is relevant tbh

I brought this up to highlight that moves comboing into grab is a big deal for Mewtwo, because his game plan is very grab/throw centric, and I would argue he has better throws than Roy. ",M2-OKK,1512432122,SSBM

"Am Swiss. We can go to most hospitals with basic care. It's mostly a non issue really. The major difference between our system and Obamacare:

1) medical care prices are heavily regulated and kept about as low as the government can. A young Swiss will pay around 200-300 USD monthly for basic plan, with a 1600 yearly cap on co-payment. With an effective monthly minimal wage of around 3k USD and a *median* monthly salary of around 6k USD this tends to work out fine, i.e. people tend to pay 5-10% on health depending on their condition.

2) for when it *doesn't* work out there are comprehensive government programs to cover the difference. e.g. students get a relatively big subsidy on their plan.",DeepDuh,1512432125,TrueReddit

And that's another good point - it started casually and now I'm more and more serious about it, and he semms to have stayed on the same level.

As for the baby - singer makes it work; I was really worried about that, but I don't think that ever stood in our way. Then again, it surely depends on your priorities and willingness to be a part of a band.

"Textbook depression really. Refuses to see the world in a positive light even when it's clear as day, lives in a world of perpetual irrational thinking and refuses to give credence to any positivity. Outright denial of something so obvious as ""no one supports me"" when all he really needs to do is go to his Twitter/YouTube comments and acknowledge the dozens of support messages rather than cherry-picking the negative as a depressive would. Look, [within 30s of research it was easy](https://i.gyazo.com/b05cb88c9f10c2d79f1158141754ef61.png).

And y'know what the sad part is? The answer to textbook depression is textbook treatment. Standard CBT and temporary drug therapy. But that only comes from the willingness &amp; motivation of the sufferer, no one else can help him unless he's willing to help himself first. It's his choice, if he wants to continue to live a life of self-pity and refusal to take the hundreds of hands offering help then nothing we can do unless he is prepared to drastically change his attitude and approach to life.

"&gt;Sati or suttee[note 1] is an obsolete funeral custom where a widow immolates herself on her husband's pyre or takes her own life in another fashion shortly after her husband's death.[2][3][4]

heheh, i knew you avoided the first google result for a reason.  
sati has nothing to do with murder, that is called murder &amp; it is explicitly forbidden in dharma.  
you know that, muslim.  

&gt;Also, suicide, is just as big a sin in Hinduism as murder.

yep.  
no one said sati was good, population wasn't against outlawing it not that anyone can stop someone from really committing suicide.  
&gt;Also this is a nice strawman - economical challenge. Explain to me how burnign women on the funeral of her dead husban relates to economy. T

well people who commit suicide aren't usually exactly in the mental situation.  
furthermore, in that era, if you didn't have someone to support you, it would have been exceedingly difficult to support one's self. 
either way, no 1 is supporting Sati and no 
that's hilarious, you think jahangir, aurangazeb and the christians were all good guys trying to stop horrible backward practises of misguided people?!  

HAHAH!!  
good to see your true colours come out paki.  

&gt;There is good and bad in every religion

this kind of reductionist, and oversimplifiation tends to put blinders onto the real problems.  
the root core values as well as important edicts define a religion and if it says to cause harm, then it is bad.  
(i.e. islam)  
there is no vedic basis for Sati, no text is encouraging or condoning suicide.  
you can try to take a non doctrinal cultural thing (btw, Muslims and Sikhs did it too but of course why let facts come in the way right muslim?)  and try to assign it to the religion but that's just a lie.  

&gt;Also, I can give you detailed stats of Female foeticide, honor killings and dowry deaths that happen in India even today and happen in Hindu homes(meaning that they are not limited to but inclusive of Hindu Homes) and are illegal according to both the INDIAN constitution and Hinduism - yet they are committed by Hindus as well.   

exactly!  
you're the worst type of lying piece of shit that tries to conflate religious doctrinal values to socio-economic ones.  
you know you do and you have no qualms about being 2 faced about your arguments.  

&gt;. This is not a theocracy, unlike whatever demented place you live in. 

yeah...says the haji who lives in pakistan.  

&gt;LOLLLLLLLL, you said that there was nothing wrong with the cate system at all. It was merely socioeconomic.

'socio-economic'?  
division of labor happens in all societies.  
nothing wrong with it.  

&gt;YEs, and that is exaclty what I am talking about. Individual thoughts and actions are different from what the religion preaches. T

EXACTLY!!  
that's exactly how you've manipulating the facts.  
knowing full well that the PRACTISE AND THE THEORY both support intolerance in islam, you're saying the doctrine should get a pass EVEN though it is inline with an individual's actions.  
knowing full well that cultural mores don't reflect the doctrinal ones (Sati for example having nothing to do with hinduism) and yet using it as a tactic to blame the religion!  
cunning and devious, like a true Muslim.  
i salute you for being true to your doctrine.  

&gt;The whole point is that even if an upper caste Hindu decides to murder a dalit does not absolve him of the crime just because Krishna said that caste system was about division of labour. It doesnt matte what Krishna said theoretically, because that is not what the people in the country have prcatised for centuries. That is exaclty whhy thecracies dont make sense, you moron.

you dumb motherfucker.  
if the doctrine says that person should be punished and the rules are based on the doctrine, then why in the FUCK would it matter what the people practise or think?  
rule of dharmic law above your backward sharia law practises.    
sati would be outlawed, infantoecide, discrimination against genders, caste, religion would be outlawed etc.  
that's EXACTLY why theocracy makes sense you fucking pathetic excuse for a slug. 

&gt;Newsflash retard - shaivs and vaishnav

Shaivas* and Vaishanvas* you stupid fucking piece of shit.  
hey turdbrain, what does it matter what they hate?!  
if they aren't following their religious precepts then they aren't representatives of their religion are they!?  
you fucking imbecile, how do you not understand this point!?  
neither Shaivaism nor Vaishanvism call for murder of people based on ideology do they!?  
show me how many murders have happened and the doctrinal bases.  

&gt;. In theocracy, people end up fighting amongst themselves and next we will hear Vaishnavs demading a total vaishnav country and Shaivs doing the likewise ans we will end up with a dozen faction sfighting among themselves and tryong to root others out or separating from the country altogethe

no we won't because those things don't exist.  
i don't know what a vaishnav is nor do i know what a shaiv is.  
i don't speak terrorist. 

&gt;However, lets give all of them a free pass because Hinduism doesnt say so.

LOLL.  
i guess you don't understand how cause &amp; effect work.  
if Hinduism has NOTHING TO DO with the murder, than it CANNOT be blamed.  
no matter how much you want to assign it the blame.  
that's quite literally not how it works.  
i know you're trying to find a way to weasel out of blaming Islam for its adherents actions, but you won't be able to jihadi scum.  

&gt;Accoridng to your theory, we should release Gurmeet singh and close the case against asaram bapu just becasue they claim to be Hindus

"I get what you mean. You're probably not wrong. I see escorts occasionally. In the last 7 years, I've seen escorts about a dozen times. I feel I am at a crossroads now; either I keep looking for a mate, or I commit to seeing escorts on the regular. Right now, I'm still in the former, but I might decide to go with the latter, later in my life. The way I see it, yes, they are in a hard place in life. A lot of them are trying to put food on the table for their kids. But, I'm also in a hard place in life (and, perhaps you are, too). The escort and I might not be in love, but we *can* sympathize with each other. For me, it's not about sex, so much as about having someone to cuddle with and confide in. They confide in me, too, and maybe that's a good thing. But, I do believe human contact is a basic need, and there's nothing wrong with seeking it out in any way possible.

I also took dancing lessons. Honestly, it's quite fun, no pressure, and very cheap. For me, it's $10 per class, with no commitments, and I get to hold hands and dance with a dozen women, and it's awesome to see they're enjoying dancing with you, too. I take classes in Ceroc, which is a fairly easy dance to pick up. It's like a slightly faster ballroom dance, with rock music. :)

About dating someone from overseas, I'm still exploring this option. I haven't had huge luck, yet, but I haven't committed too much into it either, yet. But in theory, it makes sense. There are a lot of women in very poor countries, with huge social strife and turbulence and tension. I was born in India, but grew up in US, and now live in New Zealand. I know that people in those poor countries are very practical. They want someone who is stable and dependable. The question is just, how do we connect them with someone who can offer it, and offer it genuinely. :) Maybe look into Ukraine, Indonesia and Brazil. Keep an eye on the GDP per capita, but also the sociopolitical condition. Some people will say marriage is not about that, that it's about love. But marriage has always been about practically for a long, long time.

I haven’t taken actual LSD-25 because it’s almost impossible to find now a days but I have had 1p-LSD which is a research chemical that is supposed to be a pro-drug to Actual LSD. I watched tv for a while and then started coming up and my friend asked to call because he was hella stressed so I said he could but my advice will probably not be solid cause I just had taken 200mcg. We talked and as we were talking I started peaking. And I felt very connected to him and it really helped solidify our friendship and I’ve felt much more open to him since because I felt like I could sense his energy and intentions and he is such a good person. So it was a nice bonding experience. After that he hung up went to bed and I was looking around trying to absorb all of the stuff around me. It was very sharp looking compared to magic mushrooms where all the visuals seem to be flowing and natural. I definitely feel like acid is great for bonding with people and doing stuff. Magic mushrooms are great too but I do not like being around other people after taking them. I felt a need to talk to people and try to understand the people around me and the universe on 1p-LSD. Which is supposedly exactly the same in effects to acid. So anyway. It’s a great experience [7],UnsensationalOwner,1512432130,trees

"The United States are the mass murdering tyrants.

500k in Syria with Operation Sycamore. 
Afghanistan
Supporting Saudi cholera epidemic blocade in Yemen.


I hate to break it to people on here but what is the difference in mass murder between Polpot, Hitler, Stalin, and the United States currently.

What makes the other bad?

Ideology, Method, Systematic?

I'm sure all felt and and told people it was justified...and the US is completely doing that too.  Whether people want to admit it or not.

Every mass murdered has their warped reason and rationale for doing it.

What's the US's excuse?  Terrorism?  they prop up the ideology funder of terrorism in Saudi.  

The actual real moral dilemma is whether or not the United States will actually be about its claimed values in foreign policy.

I can tell you right now that there isn't a US solider alive in any theater of war actually fighting for American citizens freedom.  Not a single one.

That's the lie that is repeated ad nauseum.    Show me one bill of rights amendment, or peace of legislature granting more freedom to the American people.

You won't find any.

George Washington and Valley Forge.  Absolutely.
Lincoln and the Union Army?  Absolutely.
Against communism/Nazis?  I guess if they believed it was an actual threat to the constitution and citizens of the United States.  I think it's reasonable to say those were legitimate threats due to expansionism. 

But this ""war on terror"" is just a ruse.  Terrorism has gone up,  Millions dead, Iraq ""weapons of mass destruction"", meanwhile Saudi who is by far the real #1 funder of terrorism worldwide gets weapon deals.

Millions dead, families ruined forever, US soldiers wounded and maimed many having trouble finding jobs or surviving in the US, and what freedom is all this about?

None.

In fact it is the Syrian government and the Syrian people's country that we are trying to ruin THEIR freedom to have a country for all religions.   I can tell you that the ""moderate rebels"" do not want religious freedom.  They want their strict interpretation of Islamic law and only that.

That doesn't jive with American values at all.

"I know, like I said, I've seen this complaint 101 times. It just never made much sense to me to grind and require all the skill and gear necessary to beat a raid, just to be rewarded with gear that is only useful in said raid.

The current method of rewarding you with gear that is useful everywhere, but extra useful in the raid, really strikes me as a much better system.

"Man, we had a similar post not long ago. I'll say what I said to that poster: it's really not about the dogs. Are they the least bit hurt or offended by not receiving hand-knit dolls of themselves? No. They'd rather have toys they can actually play with.

Your wife's upset because *she* feels left out. When the dolls were given out I'm sure there was a lot of oohing and ahhing and ""Aww it looks just like Grandkid A!""-ing. Then there's the picture-taking of the kids with their dolls that you mention in your post. That's a whole block of activities, topic of conversation, and set of photos that doesn't include anyone from your little family. Even if your wife didn't have and love her dogs she might still have felt left out.

Now is that grounds to shun your parents at family gatherings? Hell no. Is it grounds to empathize and commiserate with your wife a little without dissing your parents at all? Maybe. You can be supportive without fully taking her side.

My recollection from my university experience is that degree requirements can be arcane, and there may be some sort of arbitrary authority - a person or a committee, who can decide what to do in unusual cases without much recourse.

"**REWATCHER**

In this episode we are continuing from Yuki’s declaration of being an alien. I really like this scene in particular because of the way the conversation is being presented to us. Very off angles, which are perfectly resembling what Yuki is telling Kyon. Later in the episode we get Asahina declaring she is from the future, as well as Koizumi declaring he is an Esper. One thing all three had in common when explaining why they are observing Haruhi is that Kyon plays a role in this for whatever reason. Another thing they all mentioned as well is that something went down 3 years ago that set all of this off. 

Something cute from this episode for me was how Haruhi continuously gets upset that she wasn’t paired up with Kyon during their trip. Poor Haruhi!

Question of the day: Honestly, I don't think there is anything special about him. I know there are a lot of fan theories, and I haven't read he novels yet so I don't know as much as everyone else, but still. He just seems too normal.

"&gt; Others do so in a controlled fashion to maximize their results. Just going around helping is nothing but shallow self-statisfaction and doesn’t work in reality for the reason I stated earlier.

&gt; I am not saying you should just look at the numbers, but you should look at some way to maximize your efforts. You could look at the numbers, you could look at long-term consequences, the people around you… Also, stories don’t reflect real life. Something that is rewarded in stories (being a nice virtuous king in the middle ages who doesn’t harm anyone for example) can be a horrible idea in real life.

Don't really see how why Shirou wouldn't help others to maximize their benefits. Helping others achieve a better life and escape from injustice is the primary goal of him &amp; Saber. I would even say that both of them established a far better long-term ""goal"" compared to Kiritsugu/Archer, in that they acknowledge that they won't be able to save everybody - yet they will keep trying. Especially considering that not being able to acknowledge that very fact is what drove the latter two to despair. Saber &amp; Shirou's ideals would be perfectly receptive with series of short-term goals too, don't really see why it can't. I mean if you want to speak for ""effectiveness"", Artoria was able to extend the life of a destruction-imminent Quantum Time Locked Age of Gods Britain for 10 years. Even her worst enemies acknowledged her as the greatest king.

Just to point out that while Saber during her kingship was acknowledged as very merciful, she also had to defend her people from a variety of internal &amp; external enemies. If you would like to discuss Saber's kingship, it has been discussed before numerous times; but I can also put this topic in the new thread I will be making when this is over.

Additionally, regarding his ""unsolved"" trauma,

&gt; Which accomplishes inferior results and thus is just about shallow self-statisfaction, not to mention he first aquired the mindset thanks to sever trauma and surviver’s guilt. I guess you could say it’s an ongoing treatment for him, but ridding him of it would be the superior option in my opinion.

&gt; He still clings to said flawed mindset, what changes is that he enjoys his insanity, were is some other scenario’s he can let it go completely. Following deeply flawed ideals because they make you feel good (and again, a trauma was the start for all that) isn’t enlightenment.

He was able to make something beautiful be born from his tragic past, as well as helping someone meaningful to him do the same. That is my view.

To some people, it may be shallow and ineffective self-satisfaction. To others perhaps not. Just like how our perspectives differ.

&gt; I rather enjoyed our discussion and respect your right to your opinion. My original intent was just showing that it is possible to have read the VN and be familiar with the franchise while still disliking his mindset and how he turns out in Fate. I wasn’t misrepresenting FateShirou anymore then you were, our opinions of the same thing just differ.

Well appreciate the comment that our opinions are different perspectives.

"So, since I couldn’t write a comment for yesterday’s episode which happens to be my favourite episode in the entire series, I’m going to write for both here.

Yesterday, we found that Nagato definitely wasn’t lying about her power. It seems to be to replace data, or something like that? Anyway, I absolutely loved the baseball scenes. If you were reading the scorecard, just as a neutral observer, can you imagine how much of a god Kyon would look like? I mean, 8 strikes and 1 ball off 10 pitches? With only one pitch that the batter could run off because of a fielding error from the catcher? MLB pitchers ain’t got nothing on him. After the series ends, Nagato and Kyon should honestly become baseball players.

So far Nagato and Itsuki have been the most open about what they do. Asahina, meanwhile, has been far more secretive. [](/s ""This is a trend which continues for the rest of the series."") Asahina is clearly far lower down the organisational ranks than Nagato and Itsuki are. We get more information on her when [](/s ""an older version of her comes into the time frame who’s higher up the ranks."") Anyway, turns out that Koizumi is an esper, Nagato is an alien (but not a traditional one, more like a computer) and Asahina is a time-traveller. I’m excited to see their powers again.

Now for some speculation. So far, we’ve seen that Nagato is probably somewhat powerful in that she can cause rain to happen, but that she’s not got all that control over that power as this will cause millennia of consequences. For Nagato, as I wrote before, it seems that one of her powers is replacing data, so basically warping reality, which makes her immensely powerful, compared to Koizumi and Asahina who seem to basically be normal humans in most cases. As she is related to the data entity she definitely has some more powers related to data but it is still unclear how much power she has, as she is not a pure data being but rather a kind of communication device. Honestly, I’m surprised the data entity made her so powerful in the first place if she was just a communication device. The real question regarding Nagato is basically whether she is a data being with a physical interface-type form or just a physical interface with some data powers. The answer, [](/s ""as you see when Asakura Ryoko dies, is the first one."") 
For Koizumi, he’s an esper. We don’t have much information on what his powers actually are, but we’ll get it in the future. Asahina’s just a weak girl who came from the future and can time travel. Also, what are those rampaging monster things? And what was the embarrassing thing that Kyon did to make Haruhi less mad?

On the role of Haruhi. Koizumi provides some useful information this episode. It seems that Haruhi is a kind of being who created the world 3 years ago, and is completely unaware. This entire world, in fact, is just a dream which Haruhi has. Note that this is all only Koizumi’s opinion though, so feel free to debate it. Far more interesting, however, is the role of Kyon. I won’t get that deep into it yet, and I’ll talk about it in the general discussion, but I’m a strong supporter of the ""Kyon is God"" theory, which basically states that Kyon is the actual unconscious god of the world, and that Haruhi’s powers originate from Kyon (or the spin-off version which says that Kyon gave his powers to Haruhi). This is due to Kyon’s wishes to see supernatural things as mentioned in the first chronological episode, or day 2. The way that he isn’t in the centre of it offers him denial of his powers, so he can simultaneously deny and accept the supernatural, and he has been shown to deny it very often so far, and in the first chronological episode again you see him say that accepting reality was a sign that he has matured. [A further piece of evidence to support this, from the first light novel but not really a spoiler.](/s ""Kyon also wishes to remain an observer to supernatural events rather than in the thick of things because it would be too much of a hassle. He says he wants to be a sidekick character or something like that."") If he does want to become a [tl;dr of the last spoiler](/s ""hero’s sidekick/observer to the supernatural"") then he definitely got his wish. Also, it's totally possible that Kyon went straight-up delusional or he's just fantasising or this is a book or film that he wrote after the events of the series, supported by the fact he's talking in flashback a lot.

As for character preferences, my favourite character is Yuki. And no, [Disappearance spoilers](/s ""it isn't because of Disappearance. She was always my favourite character.) Haruhi is just unpleasant and bullying even though she gets somewhat better and Asahina is just way too moe and all. Koizumi might be nice to have as a friend, but that annoying smile... Kyon would be a better friend. As for Kyon, do you guys think he has a crush on Haruhi? I'm still siding with 'no', [](/s ""even though I've watched the entire series."")

Finally, on Haruhi’s character and its changes. In both episode 7 and episode 3 Kyon is forced to pay for meals, in both episodes Mikuru is sexually assaulted, and in both episodes Haruhi is just overall a bully. One thing I have to note is that she looks like she may have improved a bit from episode 2 because we didn’t see her blackmail the baseball club, but she she did still use Mikuru’s body. Overall, I see Haruhi as staying with a see-sawish personality that is very dependent on her mood, and don’t see a major deviation from that with episode 7. One major event happened that could have changed her character in episode 4-6 as shown by Kyon talking about it in the start of episode 7, but it seems that even that didn’t change the foundation of her character even if it (doubtfully) made her somewhat nicer at selective occasions such as praising Kyon for his catch, which is completely contradicted by her making Kyon pay for lunch despite him being the game-winning pitcher.

[MAJOR Spoiler Section](/s ""Haruhi, I agree, does become somewhat better post-Sighs at selective occasions, and it is possible that she has gained some morals, but I still feel that her underlying principles and actions are mostly the same. She continues to act unreasonably quite a bit. If anyone wants to discuss this, I’m free to do so, but I probably won't be able to answer until around 6 hours from now."") Calling u/Smartjedi.

"&gt; Let's not forget that Tennant was such a beloved Doctor that he got 3 seasons and an incredibly played-up departure.

I mean....in fairness....Smith got 3 and Capaldi got 3. Both their own choice, like Tennant and Eccleston's 1. In fact, 6, 7 and 8 were the only ones fired or stopped due to being axed. Smith didn't get an incredibly played-up departure because he changed his mind last minute so Moffat had to rewrite an entire season's plot into the single special he had, hence why I give Time of the Doctor a good deal of leeway for its flaws. Capaldi looks like he's getting a fairly played-up departure considering his regeneration story is more or less spanning 3 episodes.

&gt;Anyone replacing him was a lamb to the slaughter.

It's worth mentioning that RTD really didn't help here in The End of Time by making Tennant say this in The End of Time:

&gt; Even then, even if I change, it feels like dying. Everything I am dies. Some new man goes sauntering away, and I'm dead.

Just imagine how rabid fangirls who had Tennant as their first Doctor reacted to THAT.

Personally, I do really enjoy Moffat as a showrunner on the whole but I agree with you that there are good and bad things about all and he definitely has flaws too (e.g. Missy/Vault mysteries, some of his personal PR sucks, his handling of his friend Gatiss, sexist remarks in episodes).",pcjonathan,1512432148,doctorwho

(Okay, this hand is over that, so I can turn this way, or she can turn that way, or maybe I need an illusion?) I had plenty to work on without worrying about that. So I would use CBL to get into and out of those connections.

I've been working on cross-handed patterns that are in the range of four to eight 8-counts. Now I have a big set of ""building blocks"" that need work on smooth transitions (and order, so that transitions even work). I don't want complicated along with herky-jerky. For me to be smooth, I need to practice those transitions. 

I still use the CBL as a bail out if a pattern falls apart. Just pretend that's how that pattern was supposed to end.

"&gt;My friend at work is a Jehova’s Witness and asked me if I ‘believed’ in evolution and not creation, then proceeded to send me a video.

Say, ""One doesn't 'believe' in evolution. Any more than one 'believes in' the fact that their shirt is on their body. They 'understand and accept' evolution, thanks to vast, massive evidence.""

&gt;https://youtu.be/TnRMViEXMAc

I won't watch this video. I'm sure it's awful.

&gt;The take away for a JW is that evolution is a belief with no proof. It was a very cleverly framed question asking for a change of kind. 

Then the interviewer is both intentionally dishonest and wrong.

&gt;Any ideas? Thanks.

"Most people didn't even know what the hell Bitcoin was in 2010, and I certainly don't recall anyone talking about a crash.  And I for one haven't been calling for an imminent crash in Bitcoin, because I'm a realist.  I understand that the people investing in crypto are, generally speaking, pretty stupid, and that's something that isn't going to resolve itself overnight.  It takes time to shake idiots out of a market, and with Bitcoin, I just don't think we're there yet.  

EDIT: Also, just FYI, no one ""got approval"" for shit.  You do realize that, right?  Like, Jay Clayton didn't descent to the lobby of the SEC with a sword and a tablet and bestow some kind of divine governmental ""approval"" on ICO and cryptocurrency.  You get that, right?

Like, I clinged on as hard as I could, but then just had to let it all go.

And when I came down from literally the worst panic attack ever, I felt the most relief I've ever felt in my life, which is similar to your cathartic bad trip description. But my panic felt like hours. My heart was beating insanely fast and I was totally disconnected from my surroundings.

But, in the peak of the bad trip, it was still a personal hell that I OD'd/went insane/was dying.

When the comedone is visible, it is in the telogen phase which is the last stage of hair the final hair growth follicle. 

The article also states that the authors observed that the ""earliest open comedones did not become apparent until 4-5 months later"" ... in relation to the hair growth inside the microcomedone.

"Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

&gt; “Os policiais perguntaram se a gente tinha alguma desavença e nos orientou a não seguir viagem para aldeia, com isso, eles nos escoltaram até a cidade onde passamos a noite na casa de um amigo e hoje (quinta-feira), fomos prestar depoimento na Polícia Federal”, revela. Há cerca de duas semanas, de acordo com a professora, os indígenas da aldeia foram recolher castanhas e se depararam com madeireiros cortando as árvores de castanheiras. Falaram que iria matar principalmente meu marido, pois acham que ele que está à frente do movimento por ser o cacique”, revela Elisângela. E isso tem desagradado os invasores que entravam nas terras indígenas para comprar madeira ilegal e explorar garimpo, com a permissão de alguns índios, que acabavam permitindo a presença deles por não ter outra fonte de renda”, aponta. Segundo Elisângela Suruí, o clima na aldeia é de medo e espera que as autoridades se unam para garantir a segurança nas comunidades indígenas da região. O que dizem as autoridades Ao G1, coordenador regional da Fundação Nacional do Índio (Funai), Paulo Ricardo Souza Prado, informou que está participando do um encontro em Brasília e não poderia falar sobre o assunto no momento. O projeto de Elisângela, batizado de ""Mamug Koe Ixo Tig"", que significa ""A fala e a escrita da criança"", incluiu a elaboração de um material didático próprio em Paiter Suruí para os 15 alunos do 1º ao 5º ano do ensino fundamental, que estudam todos na mesma sala multisseriada.

Guys like these always have imagined events in their head that never actually happened, but they hear stories of girls being bitchy or mean, or see other guys espousing bullshit about this bitch who was mean when he 'complimented' her, and because they never say directly ""I called this girl a sweet honey and said she had a fine ass and she dared to not take it well!"" they always just say to each other ""I complimented her!"" like- they never actually use accurate descriptors of their actions in the first place, let alone trying to use their report to parse out their action and given them social corrections.

"If you feel that you are wasting your time what you could do is actually do something by yourself, socializing the entire time isn’t the only option for not feeling that you are wasting your time. 

You could try starting a new habit, doing sport either in a gym or learn a new team sport (which is a way to socialize). You can also learn a new language. This way you will become an interesting person as well. 

I’m also like this and I decided to do something about it,  so every time I feel I have time to do something, I try to set a new project to follow. 

Some years ago I decided to make book reading a habit because, you know, it is good to be able to read fast and at the same time be able to talk about something interesting and different; I didn’t read any kind of books before aside of university stuff. So I forced myself to read until it became a habit. So nowadays, whenever I have time and don’t feel like going out I grab a beer and start reading. 

Doing this you will accumulate a set of interesting and different skills that will prove useful in your personal life, as well as when socializing.

The show explores a number of different wild science-fantasy elements, but it never takes itself too seriously and pokes fun at the tropes of more serious sci-fi/supernatural shows, which manifests itself into its own unique brand of absurd humor. One of my favorite moments of this is when Mikuru is explaining time travel to Kyon this episode, and they’re constantly cutting her off and skipping forward into her long-ass explanation. Besides it being very funny, it also shows how the process of time travel, the science-fiction behind it, is not what’s important to the show. Rather, what’s important is just the fact that she’s a time traveler. Like how Nagato is an alien, and Koizumi is an esper, and they’re all here together to observe Haruhi and prevent her from destroying the world, oh and by the way Haruhi is a freaking god. And all of this treated with a casual air of normalcy carried on by Kyon’s exasperated narration. It’s good shit.



Other stuff:


- We finally get to meet Koizumi, probably my favorite amongst the Ultra Director’s subjects. I always had a sense that there’s a lot of dark secrets behind that constant smile of his, and the shadowy nature of his Agency is fascinating to me.


- Koizumi brings up one of the biggest headscratchers of the show, and something I’ve mulled over a number of times. This is a world of aliens, time travelers, and espers, but above all that is an all-powerful god, Haruhi, which had presumably remade the world just three years ago to include such things as aliens, time travelers, and espers, all of which have storied pasts and fictions behind them and their organizations. The Thought Entity, the time travelers group, and the Agency, all seem to realize this, so are there those that also sense an existential crisis that their entire being is due to the powers of an unknowing high school girl, that before Haruhi wanted all this… all *that* did not exist? It’s a doozy.


- I love the trippy animation in Nagato’s apartment. Compliments the mood of the scene nicely.


- Haruhi could not have been anymore obvious when they randomly picked groups. [That fucking face.](https://imgur.com/ZBR65ED)


- Favorite Shot: [Nagato takes a sip of tea.](https://imgur.com/DsHldLz) We start with an extreme close-up of the cup that’s picked up by Nagato, but instead of cutting to a shot of her drinking, the camera doesn’t move, showing the reflection of Nagato in the glass behind the cup instead. This is a really creative shot, transitioning from an extreme close-up to a long shot without a cut or even a movement of the camera. That’s some slick direction.

"I do know what you're talking about and have observed it myself, although I don't think it's a perfect corollary to ""nice guys.""

Reason being, the *specific* complaint about ""nice guys"" is that they are nice to women they want to date until those women tell them they just want to be friends—then they do a 180 and treat them like trash, even going so far as to get misogynistic sometimes. 

I don't think there *is* a similar group among women, and I think the reason for that is that the dating script still saddles men with the labor of courtship. Men have to pursue and impress, while women merely have to attract and select. The reason I say ""merely"" is not that I don't appreciate how women are held to a greater standard of attractiveness than men are, but rather because the courtship process in our society is still very much men competing for women, not the reverse. Furthermore, the beauty standards that women are held to are largely fictitious when it comes to actually attracting men—plenty of men are more than happy to pursue overweight, poorly dressed, non-makeup-wearing women. Physical attractiveness is hugely overstated in importance, at least as far as dating is concerned. 

By contrast, men are expected to perform for women to win their approval, and this requires them to get over their fears of making the initial approach as well. This primary fear is something women largely don't struggle with and don't appreciate as a struggle for men. For men, this is one of if not the most difficult aspect of dating, and is easily a huge factor to our romantic self-esteem. Simply put, while women experience rejection when they're dumped, men often experience it before we even get a first date. 

So, the phenomenon of ""nice guys"" is really just men who struggle particularly poorly with the courtship burdens that all men are expected to bear. Since women don't struggle with those burdens as much, I don't think there really is an analogous group of ""nice girls."" Women certainly do have their own ways of being bitter about their end of the courtship process though; I just think they're fundamentally different than the ways men are, because the issues experienced on both sides aren't identical.

"I used amazon extensively in the UK when I was there and the power of amazon was never the prices, they were always about the same as you could get in store or on other websites. The power was in fast delivery and product reviews.

Buying stuff on ebay is like ""7 to 25 days for delivery"". Once amazon prime gets going there should be 1 to 3 day delivery in capital cities. In London we had 2 hour delivery for some products.

The product reviews are hugely important. EBay is full of cheap Chinese crap that breaks the second you get it home and with no review system for individual products there's no way to tell. Eventually on amazon nothing will sell that doesn't have many 4 or 5 star reviews. It takes they gambling out of online shopping. Amazon also had no questions asked free postage returns, so removing shit products was in its best interests.

"As a matter of fact I was thinking about this the other day. My boyfriend joked about his dog “getting all the bitches” and I realized that in a year of dating that was the first time I’ve ever heard him say the word bitch. It’s simply not in him to ever be derogatory to a woman (or really anyone for that matter). I’d never consciously remarked on that before but in that moment I realized I was so incredibly lucky to be with him. 

So yeah, I look at subs like RPW (and friend’s shitty boyfriends) and it’s genuinely depressing. He respects me and it’s mutual. In all of our arguments we’ve never raised our voices at each other or been insulting. If there’s some kind of disagreement I don’t worry about what his reaction would be or second guess if my opinion is worth bringing up. I know whatever grievance I’m having I can bring it up to him and we’ll always work it out. In my relationship I don’t have to constantly mentally navigate some power dynamic and I can’t imagine how miserable that must be. We’re just two equals that love each other, love spending time with each other, and want the best for one another. When the existential dread of living this fleeting life on this absurd planet sets in I know I have him by my side.

It's an interesting read **but** falls victim to the same fallacy a lot of pieces like this tend to fall on. How can you tell if someone is being sexist or is just an asshole? that is the biggest question, maybe the person is a sexist asshole by not hiring the girl, maybe he had a shit day and wasn't hiring anyway or gave the same scruinty to everyone except joe blow happened to be in the field a lot longer so they choose him. 

This report also acts as if male and female are interchangeable when that is hardly the case. Fact of the matter genetically speaking men are physically stronger physically taller and easier for them to build muscle competitively. This is not me trying to justify hiring a man over a women cause he can ""lift stuff better"" but it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to see construction involves more brute force which men have in easier quantity then women. So that can be another explanation of women leaving apprenticeship programs because they pontetially cannot keep up the same level of work as the average male counterparts. 

This is proven based on how in police forces and the military, hell even high school physical standards are lowered for girls compared to the standards for guys. 

But on the job a 130 pound bag of sand isn't going to magically become lighter because a women is carrying it. There are physical factors this article doesn't even attempt to take into account as at the very least a possibility for **some** of the discrepancy. 

This report also doesn't take into the account of the ""temporal flexibility"" as explained in the other source you gave me and assumes everything is because of discrimination which is a gross over simplification.

"My vote matters because that is the only way that an entire group's vote count can ever matter. If I don't vote, that is equivalent to giving others the power vested into me as a member of a democratic nation. A democratic citizen's duty to is inform oneself and vote purposefully, and it would be a better moral choice to vote for what you believe to be sustainable and progressive policies for everyone.

By not voting, one displays apathy, which is among the many enemies of civilization and human decency. One must realize that the selfish and immoral have far more powerful motivations than the average citizen, who typically isn't motivated by grand ideals or ambitions. Thus it becomes imperative to vote in order to ensure that the democratic state is not subjugated by those who would abuse it, or even worse, end it. To practice democracy even without change, is an absolute necessity for democracies to survive. The very idea that your vote doesn't make a difference, is toxic for a democracy. Does the ordinary citizenry not deserve more of a say than the marginal minority? Of course they do! And for the purpose of democracy, parties' seats should ideally be proportional to the vote distribution. This can be achieved only by voting - only by voting do you get your voice heard.

If you believe you can make any level of difference at all, even influencing a few friends, then why not vote as well? You could have changed their vote, but why do so if you believe no vote really counts? Why bother converting anyone to veganism if you believe you don't have any power? Why even discuss it on this sub? Again, the incoherence of your view is put on full display. You have power, and it is not worth ignoring. 

It may be the exception that some individuals have greater impact than others, but you must remember that someone convinced these individuals as well. That is why your voice and vote should never be ignored.

The idea that one vote does not matter, undermines the principle of democracy and modern civilization. It's like saying that you don't matter, which is a most insulting statement in my eyes. You may feel like you drown in the noise, but surely that's better than being mute.",Quint-V,1512432166,changemyview

"1. There are interesting/challenging projects galore, but the amount of bureaucratic minutia you have to go through to get a project out the door is unreal, plus there are lots of bug fixes to do. You should discuss specifics of what you're interested in with your recruiter.Maybe they can arrange a call with a team lead on an application that might be relevant to your interests/background. Also the people who actually get to work with data and develop cool stuff in analyzing/getting medical findings from that data is a minute sliver of R&amp;D, and lots of tenured devs want to get on those projects as well.

2. average about 45 hours/week. Travel can add to that as the work doesn't stop piling up when you're travelling. 

3. I'm not sure what to compare it to. It seems higher than I would like with people that I work with. 

4. Lots of Epic SDs go on to work at Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. I don't know of as many who go directly to smaller companies which may be in part because of the older tech stack and more expectation of specific languages right out the gate for new hires to smaller companies. It might be something you can find out more about with some digging through your extended LinkedIn network.
5. No, there really aren't a lot of fun things to do. There is an annual picnic which is ok. There are clubs which seem interesting but I've never participated in them personally since there is a rule that they have to do their activities after 6 pm and the last thing I want to do is stick around

"Your buck has an input capacitor. Let's say it's 22uF. To charge it by 2V in 2us, you need 22A of current.

Your input supply is not prepared to suddenly go from nearly nothing to 22A (it would have to respond in nanoseconds).

So, the easy way to do it is to have a capacitor ready to provide that energy instead.

Your input supply likely has an output capacitor -- but it's probably small; it's also likely removed by a long pair of wires.

When you close your switch, you are shorting the output capacitor of the input supply to the input capacitor of your buck regulator. The voltages across the two will equalize (while conserving charge).

So, if both caps are 22uF, then they'll go from being at 5V and 3V to both being at 4V.

After that, the 5V supply will work to get that 4V output back to 5V, and that will take tens or hundreds of microseconds.

If you had a big (220uF) capacitor there instead, then things would equalize to 4.82 volts instead.",garnet420,1512432167,AskEngineers

They could even give her and McCree some fun interactions since he's got that Scrooge skin. I know from like a programming perspective having a character rapidly shift in appearance is probably more trouble than it's worth, but I think it's a neat concept either way.

And I know, I know - the last thing a lot of people want is more Tracer stuff, but I prefer quality over quantity and my girl has two legendary skins that are actually worth having!

I'm also fond of Winston having a Grinch-like skin and think that it would be hilarious if Reinhardt got to be an elf while his buddy Torb is Santa. The size difference alone makes it gold!",tracerscrocs,1512432170,Overwatch

Hey guys, I just wanted to give an update on the Pizzeria Simulator. I think maybe I approached this wrong. This was originally intended to be a fun little game for the community, and even though I was already expecting lots of comments about the ""poor quality"" of the screenshots, I figured everyone kind of knew my style when it came to for-fun types of games, so I figured it wouldn't be a big deal.But maybe I should have been more direct from the beginning about this. This wasn't supposed to be a ""major release"", this is just a game for the community, something lite and without much consequence. I've just really been busy this year and just haven't had much time for game making.I will probably just release the game today rather than tomorrow, but just accept my apology in advance if this was hyped to be more than it was. This should be viewed as something fun for the community, and just something to pass some time. :)Thanks guys.

"I've gone ahead and translated it for everyone!

E-Gymnasium is the first school in the world to accept Cardano ADA cryptovalut as a way to pay. More information on this currency can be found on www.cardanohub.org/en/home

What is ADA? Ada is a cryptovalue that allows a ""peer-to-peer"" payment method, is fast, reliable, and is fast-paced and applied throughout the world.

In other words, to have E-Gymnasium paid digital tuition, a broker is not required, such as Visa, Master Card, American Express or PayPal, which are just some of those who use a centralized way of doing business. By accepting ADA as your payment method you will benefit from a sophisticated IT technology without commission and you will have a 5% tuition discount.

How does this work? You can send a tuition fee directly from your computer to our computer, or from your digital wallet to our digital wallet, called Daedalus. (you can easily download it here: https://daedaluswallet.io

To be able to do this, you first need to convert your BitCoin currency into the ADA currency. Although there are already devices in Japan where you can lift Ad, but since you are unlikely to live in Japan, you first need to buy BitCoin on one of the platforms, such as cex.io or cash on the site: www.ecd. HS / pages / contact. Then switch and convert BitCoin to ADA currency on one of the crypto valued power sources, the best is www.bittrex.com.

When you gain an ADA currency, you must keep them in a safe place. It will be your personal Daedalus wallet to transfer from the bittrex.com portal. Then you will transfer your wallet from our wallet to our wallet according to the instructions that I will send you via email.

The procedure to start is still a little longer, but soon the whole process will become rationalized. What life would be without interesting and new challenges!

Always keeping ADA currencies is only possible on your computer or laptop, but the Cardano team under the IOHK control in Hong Kong is currently working on the mobile app (and many interesting plug-ins).

Send us a question via el. mail and in our response we will confirm the charge converted to ADA cryptovalut. This may sound complicated but in essence is extremely quick and easy. Currency transfer takes 10 seconds.

We are glad to download Daedalus Digital Wallet and view it. You will see the SEND (send) and RECEIVE (receive) buttons. By simply clicking on the button, the wallet will create the digital address you can receive ADA. You can now also send and receive payments in the form of ADA currencies.

I apologize for not making this clear in my post, but I did make sure to confer with my teacher and the other students on whether or not using a poncho, as opposed to a normal sweater, was allowed under what little instructions we were given. I understand now that I should have elaborated on that, but I wasn't aware that I needed to initially.

I am not the only outlier here, either; one kid is putting together an ugly Christmas dress, two are using onesies, another can't find a sweater on short notice so they're putting Christmas ornaments on a plain black shirt. Half of our cast aren't even allowed to wear sweaters at all, because of the dress code in place for Band and Choir.

I'm not great with visuals, for the sake of time the skybox was pulled from the asset store, it does loot a bit odd though that its essentially a flat image given the rotation.

One of the reasons the ship moves slow was if you moved too fast you pulled away from the asteroids you collected too quickly, I didn't have enough time to balance it so reducing the ship speed was the easiest way!

I guess in my head I sort of thought it could be an incremental game, like you try to collect as many asteroids as you can, die, get credits to spend on ship upgrades like faster thrusters to overcome the mass of the collected asteroids, faster movement, stronger magnetic field etc.

There isn't a way to avoid death in this version! But I guess you could spin off asteroids as you go so you survive for longer, so I guess there could be two win variants, a high score for surviving longer or the most amount of asteroids collected.

"I mean, so are casino games. 

Specifically, I take umbrage with this:

&gt;I have a running theory that this is why the gaming community contains a (minority, but nevertheless) higher-than-average number of toxic men. I think when you grow up playing games that are insanely difficult but always let you win in the end, there's a strong temptation to view female rejection the same way. The concept of no -- the concept of romantic permadeath, is not only scary, but unacceptably frustrating to some gamers -- and for many of them, rather than attempt to play this new, punishing game at all, they prefer to stick to the systems they know, which offer them an easy and consistent feeling of reward.

In any hobby or activity that has been consistently dominated by men for an extended period of time, there's a shit ton of toxic men. Video games is the current whipping boy for this subject, but sports, auto hobby, gun enthusism, programming, body building/exercise, etc...these are all hobbies dominated by men, and there are the same kind of toxic assholes in all of these things. They are all hobbies that offer consistent feelings of reward based solely on the person's individual input, and while they may not be as explicitly designed to do so as video games, the fact that most of these are so widely accepted as just normal things for people to be in to makes them even more insidious and potentially harmful.

If you end up doing revisions after its in audio posy either include and EDL or at least a list of shots changed somehow. Communication is wonderful but lacking with a lot of people. 

These are the bigger things I run into time and time again. Best of luck!

"Let me quote the world's foremost expert on Nazism, AKA National Socialism:

Adolf Hitler.

&gt; Socialism as the final concept of duty, the ethical duty of work, not just for oneself but also for one’s fellow man’s sake, and above all the principle: Common good before own good, a struggle against all parasitism and especially against easy and unearned income. And we were aware that in this fight we can rely on no one but our own people. We are convinced that socialism in the right sense will only be possible in nations and races that are Aryan, and there in the first place we hope for our own people and are convinced that socialism is inseparable from nationalism.

&gt; * ""Why We Are Anti-Semites,"" August 15, 1920 speech in Munich at the Hofbräuhaus. Speech also known as ""Why Are We Anti-Semites?"" Translated from Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte, 16. Jahrg., 4. H. (Oct., 1968), pp. 390-420. Edited by Carolyn Yeager. [1]

&gt; To put it quite clearly: we have an economic programme. Point No. 13 in that programme demands the nationalisation of all public companies, in other words socialisation, or what is known here as socialism. … the basic principle of my Party’s economic programme should be made perfectly clear and that is the principle of authority… the good of the community takes priority over that of the individual. But the State should retain control; every owner should feel himself to be an agent of the State; it is his duty not to misuse his possessions to the detriment of the State or the interests of his fellow countrymen. That is the overriding point. The Third Reich will always retain the right to control property owners. If you say that the bourgeoisie is tearing its hair over the question of private property, that does not affect me in the least. Does the bourgeoisie expect some consideration from me?… Today’s bourgeoisie is rotten to the core; it has no ideals any more; all it wants to do is earn money and so it does me what damage it can. The bourgeois press does me damage too and would like to consign me and my movement to the devil.

&gt; * Hitler's interview with Richard Breiting, 1931, published in Edouard Calic, ed., “First Interview with Hitler, 4 May 1931,” Secret Conversations with Hitler: The Two Newly-Discovered 1931 Interviews, New York: John Day Co., 1971, pp. 31-33. Also published under the title Unmasked: Two Confidential Interviews with Hitler in 1931, published by Chatto &amp; Windus in 1971

Oh boy! It's almost like he considered himself to be a socialist!

But, you know, [a TRUE socialist,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman) not a dirty stinky Marxist.

I do understand that socialists don't like the idea that Nazism was inspired by socialism. But it was.

&gt; insist that US and US corporations haven't done things they quite objectively have

Except a lot of what you said were outright lies. The US didn't ""burn down"" any countries, and does a lot of reconstruction work. You'd know this if you'd taken even high school level US history classes, or heck, read anything about the US budget. We've spent huge amounts of money reconstructing Iraq and Afghanistan, building roads and schools and fixing up their power grid and doing various other tasks, not to mention helping create a new police and military force there so they can protect themselves and administer the law and such.

It isn't always a rousing success, but it is extremely disingenuous to claim that the US burns random countries down.

&gt; Like I can't even address your lies as fast as you can spit them out, nor would I like to waste my time doing so.

"&gt; Wait a second. They say Vive usage is growing in proportion to Rift, but if you look at the graph they show, across all months from June to November, it's actually Oculus that's growing.

Uh...

Here's a series of four data points for Oculus:  
43.8 - 46.9 - 47.6 - **46.0**

Those numbers go up, up, down.

Here's a series of four data points for Vive:  
52.3 - 50.2 - 48.8 - **49.5**

"Attempted regime change would be more likely, as was attempted with Assad in Syria. One would simply arm people who would like to topple the state, maybe stoke ethnic or religious flames and then wait for the spark to ignite. After it does, one directs a CNN camera at the ensuing chaos and brands the Chinese state a totalitarian regime which is committing human rights abuse and destroying democracy by suppressing the ""rebels"", ""insurgents"" or ""opposition"" forces. Then wait while country tears itself apart with strife, while supplying the weapons for this to happen. Start secret talks with neighbours of the country who benefit from Chinese failure and soon you're on your way to mass-famine, refugee crises, extremist groups and decades long dispair and regional chaos, which you'll try to help by installing your own man who's pro-You and calling it democracy and stability and peacekeeping.

Judgement HAS to come before you add a skill that requires traction, suspension and control management and finesse.

"1: You can refine more than once, but the bonuses don't stack; instead, it just gives you the ability to switch between the different versions of the weapon on the skill change screen.

2: Depends on how you use her. For my +Atk/-HP Triangle Adept/Quick Riposte Nowi, I decided on the Res refinement after a lot of thinking. My reasoning was that I use her as an enemy phase unit with the Distant Defense seal, and the 4 extra Res can help survive against some blue mages like Reinhardt; her def is already good enough to fight archers (especially with your +Def one), though it may leave her somewhat vulnerable to lancers.

If you're using a Fury/Swordbreaker Nowi, there's a good argument for picking the Spd one instead since it helps avoid many doubles (33 speed when paired with Fury is decent).

"IMO wait until it's a 0 before projecting anything. If it's painful to crimp don't crimp. Want to know what sucks more than waiting 3 months to do crimpy projects? Waiting a year or more to do crimpy projects.

I've injured my A2 twice, on different fingers. I was probably climbing around V4- the first time, and V5+ the second time. In both instances I took a full month off climbing, then another 2-3 months avoiding things that were more severe than a three finger drag. In both cases, I wound up returning as a better all around climber because it allowed me to dedicate a number of months to:

1. Recovering from other injuries I may not have even realized I had

2. Learning new techniques instead of being able to power my way through problems. 

I could be wrong, but I suspect if you're actually climbing V5+ after 2 months of climbing, you probably come from a solid fitness background. You're able to pull your way through stuff above your level because you're strong, but your technique is probably pretty sloppy. Take this as an opportunity to even yourself out as a climber so you're able to climb more than just V5+ crimp ladders when you recover. You'll be able to do V5 compressions, slopey problems, slabs, etc. 

Maybe I err too much on the side of caution and you'd be fine at a pain level of 1 or 2. That's for you to decide. But I have a very hard time believing that there aren't ways for you to improve without crimping further. Focus on your weaknesses and return better, not stronger.

"How do you have your team built glyph-wise and mutation-wise?  

Do you mean Deathstar? Because you're certainly capable of beating 124 at 27k. Probably also 128.  

Regardless of your setup, a good start to 124 is popping Kirin right as the clock ticks from 3 -&gt; 4, so it will activate by 5.  

Then you pop the Turkey asap if at least 2 of your melee units have gone down to yellow; otherwise you save to pop it when they do go yellow.  

Everything that comes after that is based purely on the rng of what happened up until this point. If any of your units are already dead after popping Turkey, then surrender unless you've also taken out 1-2 of the enemy as well.  

If things have gone well, then pop Seiryuu for a quick burst, and after that Byakko asap whenever you see someone low enough for Byakko to likely kill.  

Repeat that process until you win (I won only just barely with it turning into a ""the next attack finishes it"" type of deal; either him or me). Doing that, I was able to beat it at 22k, but I also had Wheeler to silence anything exposed.  

In order to really help you though, we're gonna need to know how you have your glyphs and mutates setup. They make just as much of a difference as your team comp itself because they can drastically change the role that a unit plays in combat.",calmchao,1512432180,BeastsEvolved

2) You wrote about not wanting to be controlling so you essentially lied to him and said you were fine when you weren't. Here is the Cool Girl monologue from the book Gone Girl. I wish someone had shown this to me when I was 20. Screw being a Cool Girl. Be yourself.

&gt;Men always say that as the defining compliment, don’t they? She’s a cool girl. Being the Cool Girl means I am a hot, brilliant, funny woman who adores football, poker, dirty jokes, and burping, who plays video games, drinks cheap beer, loves threesomes and anal sex, and jams hot dogs and hamburgers into her mouth like she’s hosting the world’s biggest culinary gang bang while somehow maintaining a size 2, because Cool Girls are above all hot. Hot and understanding. Cool Girls never get angry; they only smile in a chagrined, loving manner and let their men do whatever they want. Go ahead, shit on me, I don’t mind, I’m the Cool Girl.

&gt;Men actually think this girl exists. Maybe they’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl. For a long time Cool Girl offended me. I used to see men – friends, coworkers, strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women, and I’d want to sit these men down and calmly say: You are not dating a woman, you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them. I’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say: The b---- doesn’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic: They’re not even pretending to be the woman they want to be, they’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be. Oh, and if you’re not a Cool Girl, I beg you not to believe that your man doesn’t want the Cool Girl. It may be a slightly different version – maybe he’s a vegetarian, so Cool Girl loves seitan and is great with dogs; or maybe he’s a hipster artist, so Cool Girl is a tattooed, bespectacled nerd who loves comics. There are variations to the window dressing, but believe me, he wants Cool Girl, who is basically the girl who likes every f-cking thing he likes and doesn’t ever complain. (How do you know you’re not Cool Girl? Because he says things like: “I like strong women.” If he says that to you, he will at some point f-ck someone else. Because “I like strong women” is code for “I hate strong women.”)",anzasage,1512432180,relationships

"Creating a multiplayer fps with resource gathering in UE4 is actually not that difficult. Modt of the code architecture has already been made and there's great documentation out there.

Here is the problem though, while it isn't hard from a technical stand point. It requires a lot of **TIME**. More than most people are willing to spend.

It will take you 100 hours just to get decent with UE4. If you're doing this as a hobby in between gaming sessions this can take months.

It will take you another 100 hours to understand UE4 networking, framework and C++ documentation. 

At this point you can connect to a server and shoot a friend. 

Then you have to repeat the process for 3d models, animatioms, sounds, landscapes, lighting.

"**No true Scotsman**

No true Scotsman is a kind of informal fallacy in which one attempts to protect a universal generalization from counterexamples by changing the definition in an ad hoc fashion to exclude the counterexample. Rather than denying the counterexample or rejecting the original claim, this fallacy modifies the subject of the assertion to exclude the specific case or others like it by rhetoric, without reference to any specific objective rule (""no true Scotsman would do such a thing""; i.e., those who perform that action are not part of our group and thus criticism of that action is not criticism of the group).

***

**Psychological projection**

Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. For example, a person who is habitually intolerant may constantly accuse other people of being intolerant. It incorporates blame shifting.

According to some research, the projection of one's unconscious qualities onto others is a common process in everyday life.

"Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly almost singlehandedly saved my life when I was in my darkest period of depression. 

the album explores the sources of kendrick's pain, both on a level personal to him and on a scale that is seemingly impossible to affect. the songs u &amp; i explore the dichotomy between self hatred and self love beautifully, and knowing a hero of mine could experience inner turmoil and despair similar to what I've gone through,  then be able to fight through that to bring art &amp; positivity to the world, completely changed me.

other records like cilvia demo by isaiah rashad, beach house's bloom, tame impala's lonerism, &amp; helplessness blues by fleet foxes also helped me cope with my depression, allowing me to project my experiences and thoughts into these worlds that i could escape to. 

overall i'm not sure if there are albums meant to be listened to while depressed, even an innocent pop album that has nothing to do with that darkness could connect with you in a way that helps you out, im just sharing the art that made those connections with me personally.",akaiwizard,1512432186,LetsTalkMusic

"what you're asking for does not exist. you will not get a ship that large for less than $200, and a ship that large will suck at dogfighting.

you have the anvil super hornet...i think the guy in the back can control the ball turret (if they fixed the ball turret bug, that is).

there's the anvil gladiator...more of a bomber than a fighter, but the other dude can control the turret.

the new anvil hurricane would possibly be better at dogfighting, but only has room for two people.

you have the aegis vanguard...you can have one guy in the turret and one at the engineering station. costs more than $200, and will not beat a good pilot in a more nimble hornet or sabre.

the banu defender has room for two (and only two), and i think each player can control their side of guns?

you have the drake cutlass, but if the freelancer wasn't cutting it, i don't think the side-step to a cutlass will. supposedly though it's more agile, and certainly has a better forward view, so it might help. pilot, co-pilot and turret gunner, just like the freelancer.

speaking of freelancer, the freelancer mis could be an option, if you'ld rather just fire a shitload of missiles at your targets.

otherwise, the constellation might be better for 3-4, but it's not going to be a premier fighter. at least, not until you can use the snub fighter that it comes with.",Cyco-Dude,1512432190,starcitizen

"Tired, so not sure I can articulate this right:

&gt;Isn't this lying to yourself?

Not to me.

Imagine you need to drive home past 10 fast food places. How you see yourself, plays a huge role in how you will act. If you see yourself as ""a fat slob"" you are much more likely to stop and have fast food, than if you see yourself as ""an athlete in training"".

So be careful how you word it for yourself - words have a lot of power.

&amp;nbsp;

What's around you isn't black or white. Your mind makes it so.

Everything you see and experience, gets processed in your brain before you decide what it's like.

And you can influence that.

It's always better to choose to believe what will help you, than choose to believe what will hurt you. There is no reality, only perception.

&amp;nbsp;

With that said, I'm not good with affirmations that don't ring true to *me*. I need to be able to believe them. I'm sure many others are the same way. So a sceptic might have more difficulty with it.

I prefer to try to see the good in things: ""I love running"" isn't true at first, but when I try to see the good in it, I find many things that are pleasurable about it. I can choose to focus on those instead of focusing on the bad. And suddenly it's true.

It’s why I don’t really factor in some of the more creepy lines of BR!Leo, or the Yandere side of BR!Camilla, Or even some of the more agrecious writing decisions plced on CQ!Takumi. Cause they’re different characters. 

But in all routes, all canons, all stories, and every single game Xander has ever been in (Spinoff or not) he has hired Peri. So shouldn’t that be factored into his character at all?

Should we not factor in Tharja experimenting on Noire?

It’s her one support that makes people go from having a dislike towards her, all the way to loathing her?

Should we not factor Peri trying to kill Felecia? 

This Support is what makes Peri horrible in the first place because she can’t even have the decency not to try and murder her own allies.

"The 70% off sale should help to convince your friends, and used copies are easy enough to find (although the sale will probably be better).  And the 1.8 update is free, so they have endgame stuff to do without requiring a season pass.

I didn’t get to play the 1.8 PTS, so the huge new area is all new to me as well.  It looks to be an area populated with all the enemy factions mixed together (which should be a huge challenge - cleaners and their flamethrowers mixed with enemies that charge!!).  The new PvE style horde mode and the PvP team deathmatch style mode are also big new benefits if you’re looking for new things to do.  They’ve done a big overhaul on the Underground, getting rid of the old directives entirely and replacing them with more fun things (faster cooldowns in exchange for less UI, replacing all your ammo with shock ammo, but if you burst too much of it, you get zapped, etc.).  There’s also more content added to it and better rotation, and the AI Hunters added in for more challenge, plus CHECKPOINTS which make everything better.  

Survival, everyone starts out with nothing, so other than a possible locational advantage, or map knowledge, everyone still has the same opportunities.  

—————

They also added loadouts to the game, making it easier to collect a lot of gear sets and swap to different playstyles when you’re out of combat.  And they shower you with loot, Diablo 3 style, making it easy to collect all of them (and then give you a path to min/maxing everything afterwards).  I think you’re best off just running some matchmaking content - do the daily mission stuff a few times, that’s the fastest way to get gear, with a team.  You should be able to swap out your old stuff for new really quickly.  The structured PvP stuff, your gear should be normalized, so you can enjoy playing that without having to feel like your gear is holding you back.  I think you’re best off just trying a little bit of everything and seeing what you like best, in terms of weapon classes and gear sets.  And if you’re more of a solo player, or a group player... and if you’re more of the burst damage dealer, or a support healer.  It really is an excellent game to play with friends, and if you can get them to download the trial and you guys play it together, I think they’ll have the opportunity to see that for themselves.  

I watch YouTubers like SkillUp, Arekkz, and MarcoStyle and they absolutely MURDER because they have good teamwork and communication, but you can also have a ton of fun playing solo (I know I did - I used the D3-FNC set - the ballistic shield, to get right up close and plug an SMG into the enemy’s ears.  The Nomad set is ridiculous in terms of healing, too, if you decide to play solo.  Check this out:

"Since so many comments are explaining why boob armor is problematic - both in terms of realism and in terms of treatment of female characters - I'll go ahead and play devil's advocate. To disclaim, I am a woman, and a martial artist who has years of experience practicing iaido and fencing. I am also a great lover of fantasy in many forms - literature, moves, anime, video games - and as such have been all too aware of the dreaded ""boob armor"". I've long had a chip on my shoulder about the unfair treatment of women warriors with armor intended to reduce female characters to sex objects and designed to titillate rather than protect precious internal organs. 

But let's be quite clear here. Despite multiple claims in the comments here that fantasy must be about realism, I find that absolutely not a requirement. In fact, I daresay that artistic direction and fantastical atmosphere is a perfectly valid foundation for fantasy. Many, if not most of the ""great"", most famous works of fantasy literature are more atmospheric than literal. Worldbuilding should follow a network of coherent rules, but I don't believe that all fantasy must be realistic in order to be good. I dare put out there now that most popular fantasy isn't realistic even when the general readership thinks it is. Even Tolkein's worldbuilding is based more on mythic ideals and beautiful imagery rather than the real plumbing of building a viable society ground-up. I don't think that's wrong, that's a stylistic choice. In fact, I daresay most male armors, swords, etc. are also unrealistic - big hulking spiky pauldrons, ridiculous weapons, enormous horned helmets, whatever. Of course, the notable difference here is that rarely are these male characters objectified like female characters, but if it's realism we are discussing, the point still stands. 

Fantasy obviously has the advantage of magic as well. If armor pieces are enchanted for some kind of defense, or the character is a god or spirit and the armor is more magical/symbolic than real, then it can certainly be explained. Additionally, certain armors could be purely ceremonial rather than actually functional in war. Maybe a female character is a commander but doesn't actually fight, or just appears in this impractical armor for social functions like victory parades. 

Whether or not these explanations will satisfy accusations of objectification is another matter, and probably depend largely on your writing style and how you otherwise treat the female characters. But then, maybe you just accept that you will be objectifying them, and that's that. Is it wrong to write sexy, or to have a target audience in mind? Surely not. Sexy fantasy is surely a valid artistic choice, but if your goal is worldbuilding credibility and to portray female characters as an important part of war, you're going to alienate a lot of potential readership. Of course, maybe you balance it out by having your male characters wear sexy armor as well, as spend lines of loving narrative admiring their firm yet bubbly buttocks barely contained in their tight leather thongs. At least then you'd have artistic consistency!",Aliasis,1512432196,fantasywriters

"I think it would take a lot of coding and relatively complex scripts to fully realize the potential of semblance. 

It seems to mostly be a ‘turn off aggro’ button (except for wolfhounds - *they* can sniff out a trick like that). Certain actions using semblance seemed to have been scripted specifically (borrowing Alvaro’s face to get info for instance). 

I think given more time to code, semblance could have been extraordinary as a full-on ‘impersonation’ power rather than a ‘mask’ power.

This seemed like a proof of concept or test for something that could show up in a more fleshed-out form in another title that is in development (not necessarily a Dishonored installment).

"&gt; Purely aesthetic

I am in the function over form camp when it comes to techwear, so my advice is to be very careful about throwing something on an outfit in pursuit of an aesthetic. It’s the easiest way to ruin an outfit as accessories can easily distract or draw unwanted attention. They should be used to enhance an already strong foundation of an outfit and its silhouette.

In your outfit I don’t feel the straps, balaclava or beanie with the tag showing particularly add to the outfit. Keep in mind that dangly straps that you see in lots of aesthetic techwear fits aren’t necessarily more technical or utilitarian — often they add weight, restrict movement, can tangle or catch, etc.

When putting together an outfit, do it once piece at a time. If you start with a “safe” looking base, you can use accessories to add visual interest. If you start with a statement piece of outerwear, tone down the rest of the outfit to let it be the focus.

Of course, if you need the beanie and balaclava to stay warm and protected, by all means go for it. This is more general advice if you’re trying to achieve “the aesthetic.”

"&gt;So do you’s think that if the clone wars was continue but they made ROTS as a series with it, dp you think you would have been sadder at order 66 and Anakin getting burned?

Hm, okay. Let's figure this out.

So do you think that if the Clone Wars was continued, but they made RotS as a series with it, do you think you would've been sadder at Order 66 and Anakin getting burned?

So, assuming I'm right about your question, you're wondering if the Clone Wars continued into RotS would we have been impacted more by Order 66 and the mutilation of Skywalker.
____
I...really don't think I would have. The Clone Wars was *great* for building actual characters and giving some real excitement to watch. But the reason the Order 66 climax seemed underwhelming was because the build-up to it was rather toss. The Jedi went from ""The Sith are back!"", to ""Now we have to serve alongside the Republic military, see our might!"" at the end of AotC, to ""Our powers are suddenly diminishing"" literally ***mid next time we see them on the damn big screen***, to ""Now almost all of us are dead"". 

Such a drastic pay-off demanded better build-up, and what we got couldn't be solved by any amount of post-release retconning (even if in the form of a kickass show).",DavidFTyler,1512432198,StarWars

Of course, if I googled ""hpv"", ""genital"", and ""mouth"", I would only get genital types. I tried adding ""hand"" and ""periungual"" since this gentleman said he had nicked the side of his finger. And of course, HPV 2 causes periungual warts but did not turn up results in my search.

"Well one thing I can say is that it's not just you. I am in the same situation. I'm at least average looking on a bad day, emotionally mature and stable, pretty successful @ life, and an introvert but a socially competent one. And a get a decent amount of matches with girls I find attractive. However, I've had only had one date in the last few months from Tinder out of like 50+ matches. I didn't start talking to about half of them, and about half that I did start talking to didn't reply. Then out of the 25% that are left from that, 70% of them put zero effort into the conversation, as you describe. Of the ones that put effort, maybe half give me their number, and maybe 1/4 of those actually agree to a date. I could probably have gotten more if I actually put effort into 100% of my matches, but naturally I only message the most attractive ones (which is what almost everyone else does too of course, hence only some of the matches responding)

But basically what I am saying is yes, there's no reason you should be failing that hard if this was reality, but that's how it works in tinder. I see it as being a guy, you have to just inherently knock 2 points off of your 10-point-scale rating when you're on tinder. You pretty much have to be *more* attractive and better at life than the girls you match with to get a date with them. So to me the options are basically work more on yourself to get to a higher level in life where you can get the girls you want, or message girls who are below your typical standards, or meet ppl in real life instead of tinder.

What you say to them in your message doesn't matter too much, just don't start with ""hi"" or asking for nudes. And skip small talk, my most successful opener of 2017 is asking girls what the meaning of life is, lol.",747823,1512432199,Tinder

"Hi, welcome to the game! Take a look at my [Beginner's Guide to Warframe.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ykmbone993qrqfg/WF%20Beginner%27s%20Guide%20v2.2.pdf?dl=0) It's a bit of a read, but I think you'll find it worthwhile, even if you might know some of it already; there's always more to learn in Warframe. Alternatively, here's a quicker summary of what all new players should know starting out:

1. **STARTING PLATINUM:** First and foremost, if you haven't already, spend your starting platinum (premium currency) on inventory slots, or perhaps Orokin Reactors/Catalysts (items that will increase the upgrade capacity of an item). This will allow you to expand your arsenal early, and inventory slots are the only essential progression item that *requires* plat. Later on, you can either choose to buy more plat (wait until you get a login reward discount), or down the road you'll build up a stack of more valuable items which you can sell to other players for plat.

2. **FARMING &amp; ACQUISITION:** NEVER BUY WARFRAMES, WEAPONS, RESOURCES, OR MOD PACKS WITH PLAT. All these things are easily acquired via farming, and you will never need plat to get them. Some things may seem like plat is the only option, but [look more closely at their store page.](http://i.imgur.com/vskQjhO.jpg) They will either have a crafting blueprint readily available or they will tell you where you can farm/acquire it (such as certain weapons which must be accessed from clan research). What you should use plat for (in my opinion) is inventory slots and cosmetics (colors, armor, helmets, etc), as well as occasionally buying rare items which are no longer available. Certain items were released as part of limited-time Events, but may still be traded between players. These items generally fetch higher prices, and while they aren't always needed they can give your builds or arsenal a nice boost.

3. **CONTENT AND THINGS TO DO:** Moving on, there's usually the question of ""I finished the tutorial... what now?"" There's plenty to do in Warframe. Your first priority should be completing the starchart. This means playing and unlocking every mission on every planet. You'll just follow the connecting lines; blinking blue missions have been unlocked but not yet completed. When you get to a junction (""mass relays"" connecting you to the next planet), you'll have to complete a series of tasks in order to unlock the junction and continue. Having all the missions and planets unlocked will give you freedom of access to everything, so you won't miss out on farming spots, timed alerts, or other events. Of course, as you progress to planets further away from the sun the missions and enemies will become more difficult. As you go, collect some new warframes (the game's character classes) and weapons to help you out (see point 4 in regards to this). Some frames I recommend getting early on in the game are Rhino (farmed from the Venus boss), Oberon (parts drop from any eximus enemies, which you can find anywhere but are more common on higher-level missions), or Frost (farmed from the Mars boss). Good starter weapons with low rank requirements are the Boltor, Hek, Lex, and Dual Kamas, among others. Always remember to try out as many things as possible; these are just suggestions. You can also complete quests as you get them (keep in mind that quests aren't like a primary campaign in most RPGs, but more like side stories that help add a bit of lore to the universe). Joining a syndicate (an NPC faction) will allow you to easily gain access to a variety of rewards like warframe ability augment mods, health/ammo/energy restore items, and more. 

4. **GETTING STRONGER:** A common misconception is that getting new weapons will magically make you more powerful (ie ""my weapon sucks, what's a better weapon?""). While this is somewhat true (for example, the Soma Prime is significantly better than the Mk-1 Braton), you won't see a huge jump between them without the proper mod setup. Mods are the core upgrade system of Warframe, and can be found in a variety of locations, mostly from enemies you kill. Their effects can range from simple damage upgrades, to more complicated enhancements. As far as *how* to mod, it's ultimately up to you, but here's an easy and surefire way to determine a good build (a setup of mods) for your weapon: there's two main stats you look at, status chance (the weapon's chance to cause a status effect such as burning, knockdown, etc) and critical chance (its percent chance to cause bonus damage). If you have 20% or more crit chance, give the weapon more mods that boost its critical chance/damage. Same thing for status chance. If it's not strong in either, just build it for straight damage. Some weapons require some additional thought (perhaps it reloads slowly so add reload speed mods, or its a beam weapon so its DPS will benefit from firerate mods, stuff like that). In the beginning, you won't need to worry about the ""perfect"" build as you'll still be collecting mods and won't have everything you need to get truly creative for some time, but always try to play to the weapon or warframe's strong aspects.

5. **EARNING EXPERIENCE (""AFFINITY""):** When it comes to leveling up your gear, it's important to know how exp is awarded. The following shows the most basic splits of exp-- killing something with your warframe powers will give 100% of the exp to your frame (regardless of whether it's max rank); killing something with your gun will give 50% of the exp to your frame and 50% to the killing gun; any other shared exp (such as your teammates' kills) will give a flat 25% of the exp to your frame, and the remaining 75% is split evenly between all equipped weapons (if all 3 weapons are equipped they each get 25%, if 2 weapons are equipped they each get 37.5%, and if only 1 weapon is equipped it will get all 75%). You don't necessarily have to memorize this, but it's good to keep in mind in case you want to level something quicker, or wondering why your gear might not be getting exp very fast.

6. **MASTERY RANK:** Gaining mastery rank is something that confuses a lot of people. MR is essentially the overall rank of your account, which is separate from the rank of your warframe (think of your frame as just another weapon in your arsenal). You earn mastery points for each unique item you level to max rank, the first time. To advance your MR, you'll need to craft and level *new* weapons and frames, as leveling the same ones again will not give you more mastery. The maximum mastery rank possible is determined the number of unique items in the game (3000 mastery per weapon, 6000 mastery each for frames and companions). You will need a higher mastery to unlock certain weapons and locations, as well as other benefits, such as increasing the minimum mod capacity on an unranked weapon. Even if a weapon has poor damage, or you just don't like it for whatever reason, you should always level it to rank 30 before discarding it, so you retain the mastery points for it. Your mastery points are permanent, but if you craft the same weapon again, it won't be the same weapon-- you'll have to start it again from rank 0 (once again though, doing this will not grant you more mastery). One last thing to keep in about how mastery works is that because its a static amount determined by the total number of items in the game, you store all the mastery you earn, even if you've already hit the amount needed to rank up. If you go over the required amount before performing the rank up test, your overflow will be waiting for you on the other side.

7. **ADDITIONAL TIPS:** 

- Along the lines of etiquette, something I see a lot of new players do is force-start the mission when not everyone has voted to begin (usually in private squads). It's generally best to avoid this feature, as people will ready-up when they're ready, and if they haven't it's most likely because they're still selecting weapons, or maybe changing their mods.

I knew that the time Soviet analysts decided was the best were Tuesday mornings after Redskins games.  I knew the risk of Armageddon.

I do NOT want to live through another Cold War.  I *really* do NOT want to live through a Third World War...nor do I expect anyone will if it comes.

We are a good thirty to fifty years until China has a chance to become more than a regional power into a ""Great Power"" as we thought of it before WWI.  I don't like or trust the CPC.  When my sister went to China this summer to visit her in-laws, I was nervous because I don't trust the People's Republic's government.  

I would be in favor of trade agreements and regional military cooperation along with economic development packages in the ""Global South"" to combat Red China's influence abroad, and encourage democratic reform in China.

"Because no one actually read the article..

&gt; Under this law, employers will no longer be allowed to ask applicants about their criminal conviction histories until after a conditional offer of employment has been made.
&gt; 
&gt; If an employer does decide to deny an applicant the position solely or in part because of the conviction history, the employer must make an individualized assessment of whether the applicant’s conviction history has a direct and adverse relationship with the specific duties of the job that justify denying the applicant the position.
&gt; 
&gt; The assessment must consider:
&gt; 
&gt; * The nature and gravity of the offense and conduct

&gt; * The time that has passed since the offense or conduct and completion of the sentence

&gt; * The nature of the job held or sought

So yeah, if you are a serial pen stealer and you apply to be in charge of office supplies, they just won't hire you.

However, if you have an unrelated conviction like possession of marijuana with 500 yards of a school or something like that, then they will have a harder time denying you that office job.",setodo22,1512432201,cscareerquestions

"That doesn't sound like a very good deal. Actually it's below minimum wage- if you work 40 hrs/wk that comes out to $6.25/hr. Personally, I'd say that's downright insulting for someone in a professional setting. Even interns make more than that.

**I would decline it on that basis alone.**

And again, 8 months is a shit load of training. I'm inclined to think they'll cut you loose after that time so they have a min. wage slave (but I'm a cynical asshole, so take that with a grain of salt)

For reference, I've worked 2 analyst jobs since college. Both CPG Fortune-500s w/ $1B+ in revenue. At both companies, I started at day one w/ full pay- there was never a formal ""training"" period. 

Basically the 1st week is like syllabus week at college- you do onboarding BS, meet w/ some people from various departments, and probably an online training or 2 if your workplace uses specialized software. After that, you start out slowly doing real work.

8 months is insane- that's almost 1300 hrs. If the ""training"" is even remotely productive, I can't imagine what you'd be doing. If you spend that much time actively learning a system (or several systems) you'll be extremely competent at the end of it. Which is cool, but not to the tune of $50k starting.

Got a little wordy there, but hope that helps.

"Well, the episode where Kirk met Leonardo da Vinci was ""Requiem For Methuselah"", specifically the former immortal Flint.

Both Spock and McCoy were present on that mission. Spock was actually the one who spotted the never-before-seen works by ""da Vinci"" and deduced that Flint was the same person. So presumably they would be able to corroborate Kirk's report on Flint if the incident happened as shown -- Spock on his authenticity and McCoy on his (former) longevity.

Though, I suppose it's possible that not everyone back home believed Flint's claims, regardless of his newer works. After all, he could have been just a really good imitator.

Still, you can't blame Kirk for taking the guy, and his closest advisors', claims at face value; it's not like he's an art critic himself. And then there's the bit where parts of his memory of that episode is likely faulty, on account of Spock wiping his...memories? emotions?...of Rayna.

"&gt;She’s not addicted to any substance nor does she have a mental disorder (that we know of).

She's pretty clearly addicted to food.

It's usually because food is their ""drug"" - they eat it to make themselves feel better. The chemical reactions in their brain when they eat are similar to the ones drug addicts get when they use their drug of choice - they get a ""high"" from eating.

This sort of thing isn't exclusive to the morbidly obese - think of the trope of the woman who eats an entire tub of ice cream to cope with a nasty break up. But with someone that large, there's clearly more going on. Chances are they're unhappy much more frequently (possible sign of depression, so mental illness absolutely can be a factor), so they binge more frequently.

"It response how I find this change to be ""gamey"", I feel the new method of outposts and the only hypolanes changes are all about making the game more competitive and reduce the roleplay aspect or the game. The game will become more like GalCiv, which is clearly about competition with the AI, than CKII which is more about doing whatever. This hurts those that would rather play the game casually or rp as suddenly the focus shifts.

I can't be sure this is what will happen, but these are my current expectations for what the game will look like. I don't enjoy that it limited the freedom of choice of ftls and I don't feel (from what I understand) that the new border system makes sense from a roleplay perspective?

I would guess that when recovering an injured survivor from a destroyed ship or something similar that it will work in the same way as the proposed Bounty Hunting mechanism. The injured player would be brought on board and tossed in the Autodoc. At that point they would essentially be sedated and worked on for the journey and the player can choose to sit there and wait for you to drop them off at a hospital or jump straight there and be replaced with an NPC whom you deliver to the hospital in their place.,Vargralor,1512432210,starcitizen

This is what happens when the refs don’t control the game properly.

"&gt; You don't scout college guards you scout college tackles that won't be playing tackle in the NFL. That's the whole idea behind it.. functional running game without star running backs and high priced line talent. 

There is, however, a massive scarcity of plug-and-play in the NFL lineman at the college game.  Its why Jack Conklin was drafted 15 spots higher than his talent would indicate he should go: he went to Michigan State, one of the few pro-style offenses left in college, and one of the few that teach pro-style offensive line technique.  

One of the few remaining schools that teaches this is UCLA, which, starting next season (with Chip Kelly) won't be teaching it anymore and will transition to Kelly's version of the spread offense.  One of the big pots of pro-style offensive lineman just vanished, making it an ever increasing scarcity at the college ranks.  The lack of lineman with NFL technique coming out of the college game is a major problem: its re-defined the NFL, because defensive lines have such a major edge over offensive lines these days, QB mobility is prized at an all-time high.  You can't rely on protection holding up anymore, a QB has to use his feet to protect himself.  

The college offensive lineman whose plug-and-play ready in the NFL is an increasingly vanishing resource, to the point where, the few that remain are being over-drafted.  Was Ronnie Staley really worth the #6 overall pick?  No, but he went to Notre Dame, which is a pro-style college offense that teaches NFL technique.  Was Joshua Garrett really a first round pick?  No, but he went to Stanford, and etc.  

NFL teams are reaching for the few college guys who can transition to the NFL with a minimum learning curve.  What if I told you the niners could draft Zack Martin?  Is that worth a top five pick?  Martin is a guard, with the size to play tackle, and is one of the best in the business.  Nelson went to the same school as Martin and is a MUCH more highly rated prospect.

i was in an 8 year relationship that was completely unhealthy (abuse, alcoholism on his part) and planned my 'escape' for months. i moved on fairly fast because i'd had years while in the relationship to grieve what could never be and to realize i was better off without him. it was still painful to end it, because i loved him, but i knew it was the right thing to do for me and hopefully for him too. there is also the fact that i was the dumper and i made that decision that made it easier to cope with that...

this last relationship lasted only about 6 months, but the pain and suffering i've endured because of it ending has been a shock to my system i'm still struggling to cope with.  

i just need to keep remembering that if was supposed to be, it would have been. if he wanted to be with me, he would have fought to make it work. he wanted out, to be on his own. and i need to learn to accept that i deserve someone who wants to be with me and will try to make it work. they need to believe in me, and in us, to their core. and he didn't. and that's ok. it hurts, but it's ok.

"**5th December – The Big Fat Quiz of the Year 2007**

“The 2007 show aired on 30 December 2007. The teams were:

Russell Brand and Noel Fielding 

Rob Brydon and David Mitchell 

Jonathan Ross and Lily Allen

Guest questioners in the studio were Christopher Biggins, Cerys Matthews and John Smeaton. Pre-recorded questions were asked by Take That, Gordon Ramsay and Thom Yorke. Jon Snow returned with a faux news report. John Hurt read out extracts from some. The children of Mitchell Brook Primary School returned to act out scenes from the years news.

It was the first time that the previous year's winning team - the Goth Detectives - had both returned to defend their title.”

"Prequels offer the best content for a video game. Yes the movies had lots of problems: bad dialogue, bad pacing, wooden acting (mostly), bad CGI in some cases, bad execution of plot, Jar Jar... and those things are why the movies are seen as bad by a lot of people. But people aren't asking to see those in video games. They only want to see the good stuff: epic huge scale battles with the really badass clone troopers that actually hit their targets, against highly varied droid types, across many different planets.

Most importantly people want the biggest amount of Jedi and Dark Side force users. Why wouldn't people want those? Why wouldn't they pick playing as Ki-Adi-Mundi, Ahsoka Tano, Kit Fisto, Aayla Secura, Shaak Ti, Mace Windu, Yoda, Anakin and Obi-Wan vs Grievous, Dooku, Maul, Sidious, Savage, Ventress and pick Obi-Wan and Luke vs Vader and Sidious only for the Original Trilogy or Rey and Luke vs Kylo and Snoke for the sequel trilogy instead? Why only set your game in a universe with only 4 playable force users remaining (both the Originals and the Sequels) when you can have so much more with the Prequels?

This isn't also just about force users. There are many more side characters in the PT, and also playing Clones vs Droids is different than playing with the Rebels against the Empire with stormtroopers that miss everything and got beaten by ewoks, or with the Resistance vs the First Order which is a copy and paste of the Rebels vs the Empire. It makes sense that people aren't asking for more of those.

"It really depends on the Pokemon in question. With over 800 to choose from, there's a lot to be had. But I do try to have designated type coverage so if a starter fits that bill why not? 

For my Y playthrough my final team was:

Delphox

Talonflame

Meowstic

Sylveon

Jolteon

Aurorus 

I had two psychic types with Delphox and Meowstic and two fire types because of Talonflame and Delphox. It was originally three until I dumped Charmeleon.

In Moon I had:

Incineroar

Umbreon

Araquanid

A-Ninetales

A-Raichu

Meganium

I had two starters as my fire and grass types and had only one repeating typing with Umbreon and Incineroar.

Alpha Sapphire:

Swampert

Sylveon (again)

Delphox (I got a Fennekin via WT)

Gallade

Gengar

Latias

I had three psychic types in that team with Gallade, Delphox AND Latias. And again I used two starter Pokemon.


Ultra Sun:

Decidueye

Vaporeon

Mudsdale

Houndoom

Ribombee

Dusk-Lycanroc 


Due to me wanting to use Pokemon I hadn't used before I didn't have any repeating players this time except for an Eevee.

"I'd say find one that is around your price range. Since you are learning Spanish, you have a huge selection of tutors to choose from. 

What I do is look at the student:lessons ratio. If the teacher is like 10:150, it means that on average the student takes 15 lessons with the tutor, which is an extremely good sign. If a teacher is like 120:150, it means most students don't go back to him/her, and there is usually a reason why (poor connection, poor teaching skills, pricy, etc). 

Don't forget to watch their videos and see if you can understand them or find them potentially fun to talk to for like an hour long! If you want a tutor that will most likely not respond or talk in English with you, find one with a low English ability like A2 or lower. They tend to stick to their native language and will not switch to English with you.

Good luck! :)

"**ESDgN Model 1.0.0**

**Record (W-L-P)**

ML: (6-0-0)

Spread: (3-2-1)

Totals: (1-0-0)

**Today's Game: Knicks @ Pacers**

Model Scores: Knicks -2 | Pacers 4

Blowout Scenario: Knicks 103 | Pacers 120

Avg. Spread: Pacers -7

Max Spread Acceptable: Pacers -17

Plays: Knicks +11.5

Notes: Knicks on B2B, but they actually aren't as susceptible to the B2B curse as you would expect. In fact, they beat the Nuggets coming off a big game against the Cavaliers. However, I fully expect them to lose against the Pacers tonight, as the Knicks are without Porzingis &amp; Hardaway Jr. 

As far as picks go, this is super fadeable, considering the fact that Pacers could blow Knicks out of the water tonight and the model scenarios include a Pacers -17 cover. However, when regressed to the mean of matchup results for both teams under this condition, the model only expects the Knicks to lose this matchup by an average of 7 points.

"Other than potentially adding another vet defenseman, I don’t see the need to add to the offense. They’re playing much worse than our roster is actually. In my opinion they have some of the best depth across the four lines in the league. I don’t see why everyone singles out certain players when it comes to play. Sure Panik has been pretty damn cold lately but the entire first line needs to step up. Everyone seems to want him out and Vinnie in which isn’t a good move in my opinion. I fully agree with bringing Vinnie up though but swap him with Sharpie for a bit. Maybe sit Sharp an extended time to see if he can pick it up. Not saying he’s been bad just think he could be better but so can the whole team. If I were Q(which I’m not lol) id try these lines

"To explain, like you're 5 (I see a lot of heavy explainations here, hopefully this simplifies things):

Yes there's science.  Yes emotions are physical, here's how it works.

When you feel emotions, you're physically feeling sensations in your body.  Think of the uplifting sensation of joy, or the heavy sensation of heartache.  These real, physical feelings are your body's cells and systems reacting to chemicals your brain released into your blood stream - neurotransmitters.  ""Feelings"" in your body are what make the emotions real for you.  So why do we have them at all?

The answer is evolution.  All mammals have emotions and feelings.  They help reinforce learning (i.e. touch a hot stove, get burned, learn an emotional response to fear stovetops to avoid them in the future).  They also help build social connections (i.e. a mother bonding with a child, learns an emotional response of love so that the mother is more likely to protect her child from danger).  

Emotions serve a purpose to help individuals survive (and also to reproduce).  

Hope that helps!

"I know that I suffer from this problem, and maybe you don't, but I'm gonna throw it out there for discussion.

After reading your story, make sure to look at your story from a bird's-eye view. Focus on the message and the feeling that your story leaves with the reader. Does your story generally achieve the meaning, the tone, the theme, and the message you want to leave the reader with? 

For example, if you're writing a comedy and wanted everyone to laugh, and by the time the story is finished, are you crying because it's a sad ending? If that sad ending is what you intended, then that's great! If it isn't and the overall story leaves you feeling more gloomy than you wanted, that's a sure sign your story took an unwanted turn somewhere.

At least for me, it's so easy to get stuck knee deep in the muddy details of the story. Spelling, grammar, character development, prose, dialogue, sentence structure. All these very specific things at an ant's-eye view. You can get so caught up in them that you forget to take a step back and critique the story as a whole unit by itself.

Does the story communicate with the reader the way you want it and does it leave the kind of lasting impact you intended? What will the reader be thinking about the day after they finish your story? How will they explain the synopsis of it to their friends? Those kinds of questions. Don't forget about them!",cmbel2005,1512432222,writing

It is for that reason there is no significant drilling going on in that area. In fact the last production well in the monument boundary stopped operations in 1992. It’s just so remote and so rugged that even when oil was over $100 a barrel people weren’t racing to develop wells.

"It reminds me of my friend and his ex girlfriend. She was bonkers. I met them both through my boyfriend, and he warned me about her, but I thought ‘hey, he’s gotta be exaggerating’. Nope. She was rude to him ALL the time. She thought she was ‘blunt and honest’ when really she was rude and lacked tact. She gave me shit for being younger than my boyfriend (by all of 3 years - 6 months more than the difference between her and her boyfriend) when we are both consenting adults. She told me to grow up whenever I bought myself anything yet at 21 her parents still managed her finances completely. And the best part is how utterly immature she was. We all go to the gym together, I run off and do my own thing, she insisted on sticking to him. One day she asks for help, he is spotting my boyfriend and making sure he doesn’t kill himself with heavy weights. He tells her to wait. She throws a *literal* tantrum in the gym, storms off home, he tries to look for her around his house because it’s late at night, and when she sees him she literally sprints off. I wish I was exaggerating. 

Anyway, my dear friend (a wonderful guy) has enough and breaks up with her. She pops up after 3 months saying she misses him. He tells her to get fucked, and about a week later she’s dating a 30yr old pilot and posting it ALLL over social media. Little does she know, he doesn’t look at any of it, and is completely over her. Watching her drive herself insane over it is amazing ",Jayesartokel,1512432223,OopsDidntMeanTo
"Uh, do you think that this graph helps your point? It doesn't. The entire ""but muh roads"" is something that only Libertarians say and it has nothing to do with the budget. 

Normal people take one look at plans to hand monopoly access to their most expensive asset (their house and land) to the Comcast of roads or a rich pissed off neighbor, and tell you to fuck right off.  They see what any person with half a brain sees; someone will obviously use this power to utterly fuck over property prices. My house without road access is worthless. Anyone who owns my road or any road that I must use can literally turn my property value to near zero on a whim. Once it is at zero, I can only sell to them for whatever they give me because again, property without road access is close to worthless.

That's it. That's the entire reason why when you talk about privatizing roads, everyone calls you stupid and tells you to fuck off. That are happy to pay a less than 2% of the budget for roads to be in the commons, but some Libertarians seem to think that road privatization is a key issue and that anyone who isn't interested is a ""statist"".

"All the final boss theme's are unique in their own amazing way. Battle for Everyone's Soul is an amazing remix of the Velvet Room Theme which works since the boss is constantly going through the Arcanas. 

The first part of P4's final boss them is a remix of iirc the level up theme so you're already conditioned to associate that cord with victory and greatness and it feels great. But then the second part of the final boss theme is very low, heavy beats with no vocals. The orchestral mix is radically different from the JPOP that's been playing throughout the entire game. It represents how outclasses you are and how hopeless your struggle is... until the orchestra starts playing a remix of the game's motif, the one's that been ij every random battle, in every boss fight, in emotional high moment in the game and it comes back to cheer you on and GOD I have never felt such chills hearing a game's motif before.

But Rivers in the Desert man... It's starts off very restrained with low key chords and the lyrics are incredibly restrained compared to the all the other fight songs with lyrics where the singer is basically bragging about how awesome we are and how screwed the villain is. But the song builds itself up as the singer recites about the direness and danger of the situation before triumphantly exclaiming the creed of the Phantom Theives, to root out social corruption, to create Rivers in the Desert and god it hits all the right spots and I've written way too much now. But seriously, P5 soundtrack is amazing. Nier is amazing as well but I'd okay with either of them winning awards for their soundtrack.

As I got older I accompanied porn with this routine and now I cant cum easily without it either. I also hate oral sex because of it touching my clit bare. It makes me cringe a bit thinking about it.

Recently I learned how to use a vibrator, without any fabric between me and it. It worked well. The vibrator isnt that amazing, what helped was pushing it into my clit with a lot of pressure believe it or not. Without the pressure it does nothing for me. I still dont cum frequently from piv but using the vibrator in combo with it I have about twice now.

"I can understand ~~even if I don't like the idea of~~ a Gara nerf, but I feel as though this one went too far. 

If I had to rebalance Gara, I definitely wouldn't add a health mechanic on top of her wall. Apparently DE got rid of that on Frost, so to add it again on a different frame is strange. Removing her invulnerability is fine, typically you want to have Shatter Shield up at all times, so it's understandable. I'd also make her 3 scale similar to Octavia's 2.

In addition, if a frame were to get outclassed by another, I don't think the appropriate reaction is to just nerf one. I think buffs and tweaks would be in order. Why can't Frost should through his globe from the outside in? I think that change alone would make Frost more attractive ~~not including the Free Prime promotion, I mean.~~

"It sounds like you want an original or are confused. The 1911 is one of the most copied designs ever. The original military 1911's were made by such companies as Colt and Remington Rand. Aftermarket 1911's are still made by everyone.

The ones the CMP will be selling are real military 1911A1's. It sounds good but they actually suck pretty bad compared to aftermarket options. The original sights are pathetic, they don't benefit from any improvements that have came around since the 1940's, the lowest cost CMP ones will be next to worn out with mix matched parts, and they will cost $1,000 or more. Seriously, the 1911A1 sights are that bad. 

For $1,000, you can get a very high quality aftermarket 1911 with many bells and whistles that makes it useable for more than a range toy. You can spend much less and still get a very nice 1911 (like a Rock Island Armory). 

If money isn't an issue, get a CMP Garand, a CMP 1911, and an aftermarket 1911 to actually shoot enjoyably. 

With all that being said, 1911's are just ""meh"" in my opinion and there are better choices for a first gun. ",BossMaverick,1512432228,guns

"It indirectly measures the CO2 content of the water.

pH is, strictly speaking, based on H+ concentration in the water. When you add CO2 to the water, it combines with water (i.e. H2O) to produce H+ and HCO3-. That increase in H+ concentration will show as a drop in pH. However, many other things can lower pH as well, not just CO2, and the amount of change in pH is based on the buffering capacity of the water as well.

You don't need to have a strong background in chemistry to understand all the details, but it helps. Anyway, the long and short of it is that drop checkers check CO2. pH tests are pH tests. You can't use one of them to do the job of the other one.",m1ss1ontomars2k4,1512432230,PlantedTank

Definitely want to see your GP, as cysts often disappear rather quickly, but are painful with pressure (you may need pain meds or (rarely) a procedure), and gout should be diagnosed then treated accordingly...

"**Nick Drake**  
 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/caf727f639a34fcecf32f4c229f3f7ea.png)  

&gt; Nick Drake (Nicholas Rodney Drake, Rangoon, Burma, June 19, 1948 - Tanworth-in-Arden, England, November 25, 1974) was an English folk singer known for his gentle, enigmatic songs and his virtuoso right-hand finger picking technique.

&gt; Although he recorded only three albums, critics and fellow musicians hold his work in very high esteem. Drake failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, and had a strong aversion to performing. Since his death, however, Drake's music has gained a significant cult following. 

&gt; Drake's father worked as an engineer. Although he was born in Rangoon, Burma, Nick's family moved back to England soon afterward, and Drake was brought up in Tanworth-in-Arden, a small village in the English county of Warwickshire. He went to public school at Marlborough College, where he learned to play the clarinet and piano. As a young adult, Drake enrolled in Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, to study English. His older sister, Gabrielle Drake, is an actress.

&gt; Drake was a fan of British and the emerging American folk music scene, including artists Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs. While a university student, Drake began performing in local clubs and coffee houses. He was discovered by Ashley Hutchings, the bass player of the folk rock group Fairport Convention. Hutchings introduced Drake to the other members of Fairport Convention, folk singer John Martyn and producer Joe Boyd.

&gt; He delayed attendance to spend six months at the University of Aix-Marseille, France, beginning in February 1967. While in Aix, he began to practice guitar in earnest, and to earn money would often busk with friends in the town centre. Drake began to smoke cannabis, and that spring he travelled with friends to Morocco, because, according to travelling companion Richard Charkin, ""that was where you got the best pot"". Drake's associates convinced Island Records to sign the young singer-songwriter to a three-album contract. Drake began recording his debut album Five Leaves Left later in 1968, with Boyd assuming the role of producer. The sessions took place in Sound Techniques studio, London, with Drake skipping lectures to travel by train to the capital. At the age of twenty, he released his first album Five Leaves Left (1969), which featured a chamber music quartet on several songs and had a light, breezy sound. Drake's second album Bryter Layter (1970) introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound, with keyboards, horns and several brass instruments. Both albums were produced by Boyd and featured several members of Fairport Convention.

&gt; Many accounts of Drake focus on his mythology, but a large part of his enduring popularity is due to his meticulous songwriting, prosody, odd guitar tunings and lyricism.

&gt; Drake was pathologically shy and resented touring. The few concerts he did play were usually in support of other British folk acts of the time, such as Fairport Convention or John Martyn and were often brief and awkward. Partially because of this, his work received little attention and sold poorly. Whilst in the recording studio, he was so shy that he'd always play into the wall so as to avoid people's gazes.

&gt; Severely depressed and doubting his abilities as a musician, Drake recorded his final album Pink Moon (1972) in two two-hour sessions, both starting at midnight. The songs of Pink Moon were short (the album consists of eleven of them and lasts only 28 minutes) and emotionally bleak.  Drake recorded them unaccompanied, in the presence of only a sound engineer (a piano was later overdubbed on the title track). Naked and sincere, it is widely thought to be his best work. 

&gt; At this point he considered other careers including the army and as a computer programmer, but more suitably as a songwriter for other artists. However, none of Drake's plans materialized. In the next few months, Drake grew severely depressed and maintained relationships only with close friends such as John Martyn, who wrote the title song of his 1973 album Solid Air for and about Drake and with Sophia Ryde. He was hospitalized several times and lived with Hardy for a few months. Friends from that time have described how much his appearance changed: his nails grown, his hair and frame gaunt and thin.

&gt; In 1974, Drake felt well enough to write and record a few new songs. However, on November 25, he died of an overdose of antidepressants. The coroner concluded that the cause of Drake's death was suicide, although this was disputed by friends and relatives. Antidepressants of that time were quite lethal if ingested in any higher dosage than the one prescribed. His mother recounts that he must have had difficulty sleeping and had got up in the night to have a bowl of cornflakes. It's unclear whether he took more pills to help him sleep or to take his own life.

&gt; His simple gravestone in the Tanworth churchyard bears the line ""And now we rise/And we are everywhere"", taken from From the Morning - the last song on the last album Nick lived to complete.

&gt; Posthumous popularity
Since Drake’s death, his music has grown steadily in popularity. Several modern musicians, such as Lucinda Williams, Badly Drawn Boy, Matthew Good, Sebadoh's Lou Barlow, R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck, Blur’s Graham Coxon, and Belle and Sebastian, consider Drake an important influence. In early 1999, BBC2 aired a 40-minute Nick Drake documentary, ""A Stranger Among Us — In Search of Nick Drake"", as part of its Picture This strand. The following year saw the release of a documentary by Dutch director Jeroen Berkvens, titled A Skin Too Few: The Days of Nick Drake and featuring interviews with Joe Boyd, Gabrielle Drake, audio engineer John Wood and arranger Robert Kirby. Brad Pitt is a fan of Drake and, in 2004, he narrated a BBC radio documentary about the singer.

&gt; Island has responded to Drake’s popularity with several new releases including Time of No Reply (1986), an album of unreleased material including four new songs recorded in 1974, Way to Blue: An Introduction to Nick Drake (1994), a ""best of"" album, remastered HDCD releases of his three studio albums in 2000, and Made to Love Magic (2004), featuring one new track and some newly recorded orchestration for a previously released track. A replacement for Way to Blue called A Treasury was also released in 2004 on Hybrid-SACD.

&gt; In 2000, Volkswagen licensed the track Pink Moon, the title track from Nick's third release, for a particularly serene car commercial in the US. The advertisement caused a significant bounce in Drake’s popularity, bolstered by uses of Drake's music on a number of film soundtracks, including 1998's Hideous Kinky and Practical Magic (featuring ""Road"" from Pink Moon and ""Black Eyed Dog"" from Time of No Reply, respectively). In 2001, two Bryter Layter tracks appeared in mainstream films: ""Northern Sky"" in Serendipity, and ""Fly"" in The Royal Tenenbaums. In the same year, ""Cello Song"" from Five Leaves Left was featured in Me Without You. In 2004, ""One of These Things First"" appeared in Garden State and ""Northern Sky"" was featured again, this time in Fever Pitch.

&gt; Drake's ""River Man"" has become quite popular among Jazz musicians. A piano improvisation based on the melody was released by Brad Mehldau on the album ""Progression: Art Of The Trio, Volume 5"", and a Jazz vocal version by Claire Martin appears on the album Take My Heart.

&gt; Drake's posthumous popularity has made many fans consider the lyrics to ""Fruit Tree"" a song from Five Leaves Left prophetic: “Fame is but a fruit tree / So very unsound. / It can never flourish / Till its stock is in the ground. / So men of fame / Can never find a way / Till time has flown / Far from their dying day.” In 2004 two of his singles reached low positions in the UK charts - ""Magic"" and ""River Man"".

&gt; Most recently, Nick Drake has emerged as a key influence in the resurgence of 1960's and 1970's folk traditions, apparent in the works of artists including Devendra Banhart, Joanna Newsom, and Six Organs of Admittance.

&gt; In 2005, performer Beck updated his website during Christmas time with covers of three songs from Pink Moon: ""Pink Moon"", ""Which Will"" and ""Parasite.""

&gt; Family Tree, the next Bryter Music/Island record was released in July, 2007. Read more on Last.fm.

"Sure, a lot of the messaging thus far been reflected in the media by MLA's rather then party statements other then from Jason Kenney. As the majority of these MLA's are former Wildrose it's certainly not surprising they still sound similar to the Wildrose. Something I am paying closer attention to is going to be the ratio of former PC/Wildrosers winning riding nominations coming up. This is an essential tidbit as the PC's and Wildrose in many ridings are quite balanced so they'll be inclined to pick moderate MLA's. 

I have genuine belief that the UCP will never risk itself going into territory the Republican party for some mad reason has embraced. Knowing Jason Kenney personally he holds Donald Trump's style of politics in contempt and a lot of his messages share that sentiment. Jason Kenney federally in particular spent a lot of time working with ethnic communities to improve their vote share to the Conservative party. This actually won them the federal election in 2011 so I assume that'll be the continued strategium.  

I'll be frank, there is about 40% or so of NDP policies that I find perfectly agreeable like the ban on certain door to door sales and some Keynesian spending. (Jim Prentice's budget was only $2 billion less in expenses then Notley's for 2016.) Now that doesn't mean I find having made the UCP a Faustian deal. I was an advocate of merging the two parties back when Prentice was Premier. It was just done dramatically wrong and likely cost Jim his career. A United Conservative party will moderate both the hard red tories and the fubar libertarians. 

Well to give context I live our in farming country in Central Alberta. So the first mess up was Bill 6 which in a legislative capacity looks like it was initially crafted out of what a guy in Edmonton thought farmers did rather then what actually happened. A neighbor can no longer ask me for help on their farm if a farm hand gets injured in bureaucratic terms. 

The NDP are also proving themselves unable thus far to remove themselves from deficit spending. Under the Prentice plan at the start of 2017 the move to return to a surplus would've been committed to whereas the NDP seem to only even be playing lip service to reducing spending out of fear from the polls. Joe Ceci in particular has been a disappointing Finance Minister as prior to what I saw from him in Calgary Council he was relatively good. 

Their management of the oil patch has been bad because in contrast to previous government it's been benign neglect in a period where the Governments role should've been reaffirming confidence in the oil patch. I can rave about the egregiousness of the carbon tax but in particular it was the NDP's complete lack of will to strengthen investor confidence here that made 2016 such a bad year.

She also seems disinclined to *strongly* advocate for Alberta federally. I say this of course knowing the limitations of the role and her strategy of working with Trudeau the younger bilaterally of course. But she showed almost zero anger when Energy East ceased any effort to exist due to constantly shifting NEB demands. The NEB is not meant to be an elastic measure by which to enforce an agenda by the Government of the time and she was insufficiently concerned about that precedent in my books.  

In addition the NDP are showing far less of the appeal they did in 2015. Notley no longer seems inclined to avoid dirty politics which was what rewarded her with the premiership in the first place. Being not particularly optimistic and throwing wedge issues at the electorate is no way to earn points in my book. It's what turned me off to Redford and nearly made me leave the PC's then. 

As someone who just graduated this year too the NDP's promises educationally have not amounted to much. A few trinkets aside I saw very little genuine usage of the funding Notley maintained in my high school to any constructive end. Add reworking of the school curriculum in manners distinctly nonacademic and I believe nothing worth voting for the NDP in 2015 has been delivered. 

All and all, their politics has been reminiscent of the late PC's much more then the UCP. Which is nothing we should try to hold onto for nostalgia's sake or quality of life for Albertan's in the long run. ",Venom_Big_Boss,1512432233,alberta

He was still a brilliant high school student and was able to, on his own, develop his web shooter tech so again it's not like they made him a dunce or anything.

I can see your issue with the plot holes of having no consequences for his behavior from his school, but that seems pretty minor IMO, and certainly not something I would hold against the movie as a major issue.

"&gt; the patriarchy doesn't directly cause the result of socialization it however IS responsible for the socialization and removal of the patriarchy would remove social conditioning

So, what you are saying is that the problem isn't ""the patriarchy"", it’s how women are socialized?

I think we can agree with that. Which, if you recall, has been my point all along. That rather than discussing a logical nexus between how people are socialized and discussing possible ways to alter that socialization, some feminists have a tendency to just wave ""the patriarchy"" around as a magic fix. Then instead of actually explaining the link from point A ""the patriarchy"" to point b ""the issue that needs fixing"", they throw out a ""well, trust me if you really knew feminist theory, you'd agree with me."" Which, just to be clear since you haven't been getting my hints so far, is literally the thing you are doing right now.

Personally, i don't think it's appropriate to blame ""the patriarchy"" for how women are socialized around dating. First, I think it's much more appropriate to blame feminine notions of polite and socially correct behavior for a generally passive attitude toward interaction with others. Engaging in social contact with someone who may not want you to is an inherently *aggressive* action. Second, I think that to whatever degree ""the patriarchy"" still exists today, it does not restrict women from chatting up dudes first. Maybe 100 years ago, one could say that men frown upon women asking them out. But in 2017? Even the most socially conservative dude is totally ok with it.

&gt; Of course I didn't preface my argument with ""some feminists are dumb"" because no shit some people in everything are dumb.

Then why did you argue with a post whose essense was ""people don't have an issue with feminists because they point out that world is not perfect, they have an issue with feminists because sometimes they say dumb shit in an attempt to fix it"".

Thus, I don't think you should let strategic dating timing determine whether to be a PA or a doctor. I think the decision depends on what path will fulfill you being the best version of yourself. Also, ask yourself why you want to be in medicine, and figure out which career path may fulfill your intentions best.

But like phil always say. Let them bury their own graves while you be the bigger person.

I honestly don't see those assault charges actually sticking after watching the video and knowing the extent of the law that people are throwing about.

It boils down to... These two got in his face... stole his items... and he used physical force to retrieve them. Which is allowed in this state. The only thing that might ding him would be if he used ""Excessive force"" Which I don't see. Again keep in mind its okay to tackle thieves under this law.

Truth be told... the girl who stole his speech however.. could actually get dinged. Which is why alot of people say... Just be the bigger person and let them bury themselves. Because rules ironically tend to fall in their favor.

Personally I think a far more powerful statement could of been made by simply holding a speech of an opposing view. Held at the same time. Then have everyone go to that speech and nobody go to his speech.  Leaving him talking to an empty room, while the opposing speaker is speaking to a filled room. Which is an extremely powerful statement.

Whoever was in charge of securing and setting up this arrangement. Security was far understaffed. People had ready access to the speaker... which is bad no matter who is speaking. And worse of all. In order to exit the room you had to walk past this speaker.

Despite better production values and actors who showed up sober, this is worse than the original in a weird way. The original is so inexplicably weird and awful to the point of being surreal, that it suddenly acquires a new appeal. The Room *is* 'good' in another sense. It's fascinating and hilarious; it demands your attention. Yours is just a bad movie. More upsetting than the original because it has the look and feel of competent people failing.

"The high tier ammo that nobody ever sees is a good example of the problem though. Say there was a limited supply of BS 5.45 ammo, and let's say they fix trader scripting, but there are quick buy templates. Now lets say i save up 500k roubles to just buy 500k roubles worth of BS ammo, set up a template, and wait for the trader reset. As soon as the traders reset anyone who isn't counting the seconds down to reset with a template ready is gonna be SOL one minute later. The point of all of this is that the extra time spent buying individual items in my opinion is not a big deal compared to just never seeing limited good items in a trader menu without counting down to resets",ThatOneFox,1512432238,EscapefromTarkov

Note that while a casual gamer indeed might not care as much because they don't want to win as much, the same argument can be flipped around: they might care a lot *more* because they just want to have a good time and someone ruins it.

"Hi Nate, I'm really excited about the inaugural season of the Overwatch League. Congratulations to to you and everybody else responsible for making it a reality.

1 - Is moulding OWL to be like a traditional sports league a long-term goal you are working towards? For instance, can a major-league style draft system (for new players entering the league) be a viable model for an e-sports league?

2 - Looking at the schedule, OWL operates weekly from Wednesday-Saturday. Is there scope for at least some matches to occur every day (like in baseball or basketball) in future seasons? How did you arrive at the conclusion of each team playing 40 matches, and is that the total you would like to remain with going forward, regardless of expansion?

Thanks, once again.",georgehh95,1512432245,Competitiveoverwatch

The overall talent and coaching masked a lot of the OLine deficiencies in 2015 and 2016. But when we played teams like Iowa, Ohio State and FSU in 2016 it showed how bad our OLine was. Harbaugh has successfully rebuilt every position except OLine and QB, both of which showed a lot of promise this season. The run blocking consistently improved as the season went on and Peters was a huge upgrade from O'Korn. If it weren't for O'Korn playing we probably split the UW and OSU games this year IMO. Playing freshmen line players against teams like MSU, PSU and OSU is a recipe for disaster. 2015 vaulted everyone's expectations of Harbaugh and I'd say we've met the projections for this year except for losing to you guys.",CJ_Beathards_Hair,1512432100,CFB

So while I 100% agree Curry has an unprecedented offensive impact, and distorts defenses in a way that even the best scorers couldn't do with his shooting ability.

However, just to throw some credits in for KD. He's an amazing defender as you mentioned. He can protect the rim, play string perimeter defense, and be a threat all over the floor with his length. But KD is also extremely consistent, he can get you a cool 30 a night if need be, while Steph can occasionally be a victim of the hot and cold nature of jump shooting. If KD is having a cold night, he can easily get himself to the line, whereas Steph has had difficulty with this in the past (though recently he's been working on this, to positive effect).

Like I said, I agree with your analysis, but I think it's very close, and felt I had to give KD some credit.",fitnesshalp45,1512432067,nba

"I don't know. He was the MVP a few years ago, and now he must be aware of what people say about him - on tv, twitter, places like this. He was a hometown Chicago hero who grew up idolising the Bulls, he must have looked up at that retired 23 every night and pinched himself, but in the end he had to leave quietly by the backdoor. He was once the number one Adidas athlete, and would have since had to hear plenty of times that the marketing budgets have been slashed, the clothing line cut, that the priorities now are Harden, Lillard, the generic shoes... that no-one cares about D-Rose any more. He can't do what he used to do, can't be who he used to be. And the injuries just keep on coming. The letdowns. The disappointments. The humiliations. He might feel like he's letting fans down, letting family down, letting the people who pay him the millions down. He's said before that he has social anxiety, is a bit of a loner, struggles a bit with the public pressure (and that's when everything was good - remember how this sub loved that footage of him awkwardly staring at his feet while his other extrovert All Star starters danced around?) And this is all very public.

"The NFL definitely has a star problem. 

The NBA realized a long time ago that the nature of the game perfectly coincides with the marketing of stars. 

It's very believable that one player is amazing when he changes teams and the whole franchises changes.

This isn't true with the NFL. Stars change teams and die from lower production. 

Football as a game is just super diversified as regards to one player making a difference.

There are a ton of examples, but one that fits for me is when the Eagles made the Superbowl about 10 years ago with McNabb as the QB. Tyrell Owens was a super star reciever who was just amazing.

Still, he got hurt and it didn't even affect the team. They still made the playoffs, even the Superbowl without him.

He came back for the Superbowl, but they still lost.

Losing a first team NBA player means you go from making the finals to barely making the playoffs. 

The NFL has Qb's, but even their impact is diminished because they play poorly so often and cost their team games as well as win games.

Cam Newton can throw 3 picks one week and look like shit, then the next throw 3 TD's and look great the next.

It's hard to believe he is this amazing awesome player when he shits the bed every third game.

The NFL only has like three or four players that really are stars on the NBA superstar level, all of them are QB's. 

That's four for about 1500 players on 32 teams.",matrix2002,1512432206,nba

"Maintain better efficiency over the next 2/3 seasons. Hardens raw numbers are inflated right now because the Houston offense is designed to run almost exclusively through him and he rarely plays off the ball (might change with Chris paul), its a system designed to make him look good where Curry isn't asked to do everything in the warriors offensively. What sets curry apart from his contemporaries is he doesn't just create his own shot and create assists with the ball,  its both he's efficiency with his shots, and the fact that he creates pressure on offense by moving WITHOUT the ball. He can create assists for his teammates that way by forcing the defense to move - even if he doesn't get the shot himself.   If harden does that thing where if he doesn't have the ball he just stands straight up in the corner waiting for the possession to end,  then in my mind he'll never be as good as curry.

You're talking about tourists, why would people who live there want to park RVs?

I didn't mean it to come off sounding like I had given up or that I simply tell kids to ""Walk away"".

I guess I just don't think traditional methods are working.  And I'm starting to think that a better method likely lies with those who have been bullied in the past.  I'd really just like to ask those who have been bullied extensively what approach they wished a teacher would have taken.

&gt;Six women who came into contact with Arnold Schwarzenegger on movie sets, in studio offices and in other settings over the last three decades say he touched them in a sexual manner without their consent.
&gt;
In interviews with The Times, three of the women described their surprise and discomfort when Schwarzenegger grabbed their breasts. A fourth said he reached under her skirt and gripped her buttocks.
&gt;
A fifth woman said Schwarzenegger groped her and tried to remove her bathing suit in a hotel elevator. A sixth said Schwarzenegger pulled her onto his lap and asked whether a certain sexual act had ever been performed on her.

Why the fuck would you not let a woman run a marathon? 

Apparently there was at least one reason in 1967. Surely this gentleman wouldn't do it without a reason!

Sadly now American culture spread all over the world like cancer and we have feminism too even though it is really unnecessary. But apparently everyone needs it like hamburgers. Which are also unnecessary but unlike feminism they can be tasty.

"You don't get it, the employer doesn't pay unemployment as they do in the US. Think of EI as an insurance, every worker pays into it. I took maternity leave, and I can tell you that the amount I was paid is peanuts compared to what I was paid for the year;so it's not on the government's dime. Honestly, what's more draining on EI is seasonal workers and supplementary school employees (hear me out). Technically, while on regular benefits, an individual is supposed to be actively looking for work, many people do, they'll have summer and winter jobs... but many when their season is done will go on EI and because they have a job next spring, will not actively look for work/half-ass look for work. School employees, same sort of deal (teachers on contract are exempt), but the EAs, secretaries and what not are only paid 10 months out of the year, so for the summer months they go on EI, again, these individuals often do not whole heartedly look for work and are happy living off a reduced income. 

As for work, most places hire contract workers for a year period, most women give their employer time to find a replacement. 

Also, in order for a woman to qualify for benefits with each maternity leave, they still must accumulate the required hours for each an every claim, so they must be a contributing member of the labour force. If you don't have the hours, no EI benefits for you, period. 

Maternity/parental benefits are but two of the benefits from EI. Individuals can get EI while attending the in-class training portion of apprenticeships... but I don't see that as a burden, I mean these people chose to persue an apprenticeship, I had no say, but my premiums in part went to pay for them to get paid while studying. That's self-induced unemployment for the weeks they are in class. Your argument is stupid, and you should feel stupid.

Not even going to address what you think goes on during mat leave, honestly it was a hard  fucking year... it is work, different than that of my regular job, but just as demanding, because there is no lunch break, no clocking out... 24/7 nanny add having anemia that required iron transfusions up to 8 months postpartum and throw in some postpartum depression/anxiety and it was so much fun /s

"Contracts with insurance companies vary so widely so they have to build in a buffer amount which makes the charges appear to be very high.  Not at all related to cost.  This bill will go to insurance company ""X"" and have an agreed upon contract of reimbursement as a % of charges or a flat rate.  Reimbursement for this bill will probably be much lower 20-30% of Total Charges.  The remaining amount will be written off as a ""Contractual Adjustment"" and potentially a small amount billed to the patient depending on how good their insurance is (deductibles, co-pays, co-insurance)
Breakdown example: 
Total Charges 42k
Total Contracted Reimbursement: 10,500

"&gt; You’d opt for the latter ever single time. Which shows your true colors. 

You seem to like making assumptions. That's just the most blatant.

I wonder, though, about why you seem to think it ""won't solve the problem"" when it **has** in every other industrialized country in the world? The solution is **not** to give the insurance companies **more** power, it's to get them *out of the way*.  EVERY SINGLE TIME you have a middleman, that middleman needs to get paid - and they do that *by making costs HIGHER*. There's just no other possible way for it to work. 

&gt;  Allow businesses to compete: this always results in better services at lower prices. 

And this is just so wrong-headed it's idiotic. There IS no 'competition' in healthcare. When you're unconscious in the back of an ambulance, you don't have the opportunity to sit back and decide, ""No, don't take me to THAT hospital because it's too expensive.""  When you have people signing up for 'only the healthcare they *think* they'll need', then it makes it more expensive - because they didn't *think* they'd need to spend 6 months in the hospital in a coma and they didn't get enough coverage for that - but the hospital isn't going to kick them out in the middle. So the costs add up, and who's going to pay for them? Or do you recommend just unplugging the oxygen when the person's insurance runs out?

I could go on, but you've obviously made up your mind *in spite of* the many, MANY studies showing the exact opposite. If facts don't affect you, I doubt *I'll* make a dent in your self-righteousness.

"&gt;Burger places aren't MEANT to pay a living wage.

Says who? You? Those jobs are just like any other job. They're meant to make the companies money while paying as little as they can get away with. Do you think a receptionist works harder than the guy at the drive thru in the middle of summer with cars around the block? I believe in an America where any person who works hard should get at least a living wage and basic benefits. If a company can't do that then they shouldn't exist. 

How about you show me where, anywhere, that designates what jobs are meant to pay a living wage and jobs that aren't. It's delusional. There are no designations. You tell yourself many many jobs aren't meant to be jobs you can live on so you don't have to feel shitty going to places people are paid like slaves. 

Most retail doesn't pay a living wage, you should know that. Yet you claim it's easy to find a job with a living wage and healthcare. Fast food is much worse than working retail and much worse than many jobs you respect. Besides fast food there's loads of low paying shitty jobs. Nobody wants to do those jobs because it sucks and comes with no respect even though many of these people are working full time or close to it and getting shit on. You know that work ethic you worship so much? Your views make you a hypocrite. That's not something America should be about. Work is work and somebody needs to do it. There's only so many jobs and some people are going to have to be working the shitty jobs. They should at least get paid enough to have something in life even if it's the bare minimum to get by on. 

I'm an American. I don't give a fuck about Europe nor do I think America should be like Europe. We need to do better for our people our own way. It's sick enough people turn their backs on their own people when they have enough for themselves.

I have benefitted a lot from the system, and I know for certain that I will pay back more than what I've received. I know for certain that my dad has paid more taxes than what any of his kids have received, but I am glad that some of my friends that I went to school with weren't completely fucked due to their parents being ill/incapable of holding a job!

It's horrible machine denying any form of freedom to its victims only to brutally separate them from their family and murder them...

Most everyone is going to have health issues of one kind or another at some point in their lives. Healthcare is (or should be, imo) a public service that everyone *needs* eventually.  Instead of treating it as such, we let insurance companies run the whole thing and inflate the costs for everyone for no real reason other than selfishness.  Folks are so preoccupied in thinking of having to have to pay for someone else's healthcare as a violation of their freedom that they don't even realize that it often costs them thousands of dollars more every single year not to.

&gt; People want shit handed to them on a silver platter simply because they're American. How about you prove your worth instead.

We literally line the pockets of hospital owners and insurance executives with our hard earned money every single year while the rest of the developed world does it better for half the cost.

"Because your sentiment, plainly, is just wrong. Firstly, there's a limit on how ""innovative"" you can be. We had 1D games, then we had 2D, then we had 3D, then graphics got better and better, then we animated faces, used mocap, no we're stumbling into VR, which is still in its infancy...and until that is mainstream and well developed there just won't be any great innovations any more, because we've already done pretty much everything. So devs are going back to the roots and infusing classic genres with new features. And that's still cool. Secondly, there's been dozens of great games this year alone, not necessarily AAA games, but who cares? The best games I had the most fun with were small indie games for little money. Because they LACK the budgets big titles get they actually have to be ""innovative"", which breaks the usual AAA formula these days.

"The initial plan was for 90 days to give the administration time to conduct a full and unprecedented review of the vetting guidelines for each of the named countries, as well as many others not named in the initial ban.  That review was concluded and the new travel ban was implemented based on the findings of that review.

Simply put, you don't have a clue what you're talking about.

https://www.lawfareblog.com/reality-sets-federal-courts-travel-ban-was-temporary-pause

&gt;With the president’s proclamation Sunday, reality has set in. Even while charges of animus and bigotry were flying, behind the scenes, the executive branch undertook a methodical review of the “identity-management and information-sharing capabilities, protocols, and practices” of more than 200 nations. The proclamation noted that this was “the first such review of its kind in United States history,” and could not have been conducted in the first week after the inauguration or, for that matter, in March. The earlier executive orders were never designed to implement a permanent travel ban against Muslims but, instead, were needed to provide a “temporary pause,” during which a new policy could be reviewed and implemented. And the rationale for selecting these countries was based on objective criteria regarding how each nation shares information with the United States—precisely the grounds stated in the March executive order.

&gt;...

&gt;The far likelier scenario is that the courts will finally recognize that the government’s request for additional time to create an intricate and fact-based entry plan was legitimate all along; that producing a policy of this length and magnitude, which had never been done before, required widespread coordination within and without the government; that requesting foreign governments tweak their procedures could not be done overnight; and that excluding from the new list some countries that were initially suspect, but which were able to fix their procedures (such as Sudan), suggests that the United States government was acting in good faith after all.

"No it doesn't. And I've hated Hillary since before she was first lady. Hated Trump since the 80s too. His wife's campaign ended months before he was chosen to take over the Clinton email scandal. So there was never a tit-for-tat arrangement on his appointment. That arrangement was fully between his wife and the democratic party, and concluded months before his appointment. That she was a Democrat, and her funding came through the same party channels as any other party backed Democratic candidate is to be expected.   

This will fill you in on why the FBI position was actually the correct one from a legal standpoint.  

http://prospect.org/article/why-hillary-wont-be-indicted-and-shouldnt-be-objective-legal-analysis

Basically their punishment options with Hillary were only applicable if she were still employed and running those servers (there are no federal laws concerning her email server, only department policy, and any enforcement would require her to still be employed with the agency). The fact that she had already left that position, hamstrung them as to what they could do concerning the email server. Her rank as head of the department further hamstrung them because as director she had authority to disclose classified information from her department as she saw fit. 

Add to that the fact that Hillary was notorious for only conducting face to face meetings when involving anything that might even remotely be considered a grey area (no paper trail of her giving instructions to others to carry out) You have a very frustrated prosecutor, who may know she's guilty, but can't actually prove it.   

And as much as I hate it, I think the FBI actually stood by its principles and dropped the case when it couldn't find a smoking gun. The fact that she ran the server wasn't something they could charge her for, (there is no actual law against it, it's just against department guidelines/policy, and therefore only subject to internal discipline, not a federal crime).  

If you ever read about those taken down around the Clinton scandals, you'll find a common thread, they were all directed to carry out xyz, but they never have proof, because the instructions were always given face to face, no paper trail. The Clintons need only deny they gave such instructions, and the others are hung out to dry, because those Clinton lackeys gave ample written instructions to others, implicating themselves.

"I have this badly and understand that thoroughly, but, I don't know how to put worth to myself besides sacrifice, or averting pain :(

I look in the mirror and see a lost cause most of the time and have a hard time convincing myself that I'm worth the effort. I feel that things that naturally come to others are far beyond my grasp let alone incorporating into my daily routine. I do exercise and seek hobbies, education and friends but the majority of my efforts feel like lonely misguided attempts at fitting in where I don't belong and sometimes I just want to give up and feel a deep hatred for myself for being so weak and feeling so out of place, struggling to breath where others are singing, ruining the choir of daily life with my weezing and sobbing. It's hard keeping company for me when I feel like I'm an emotional lead weight that needs to be pampered just to function properly and that my company can be a giant venting session sometimes that isn't worth humoring and can be a drag to be around.

I have people that depend on me (some unknowingly) and looking after them is probably the single greatest joy I have that feels real. They don't mean to be trouble when they are, and don't have me in mind as a safety net or anything, but when I see the genuine content, gratitude and happiness of someone who puts their trust in me or acknowledges my sacrifices in their names, it gives me life. Life in a way that I simply can't generate on my own because I haven't found a way to.
 
I try to keep a realistic perspective on how appropriate  giving to others is in any situation  but more often than not I feel more accomplished giving and reaping the feeling of value it gives to myself than counting my losses.

It doesn't help that I when I do spend anything on myself be it time energy or emotion, I feel empty, I don't get happiness a lot of the time. I've recently found some joy spending some money I spent on myself but it's coupled with a lot of guilt. A WHOLE lot of guilt.

1. healthcare: ""but if they get sick its their fault, not mine. screw making it better for everyone"". healthcare works because everyone wins. It's not a zero sum rule. You end up paying a part of their treatment in taxes? sure, but they pay for your's. not sick? They pay for your visit to the doctors/dentists/eye guy and don't tell me you lived for decades without seeing a doctor even once.

2. consumer protection is still decades below other first world countries. An american recently told me on a different subreddit that consumer protection is a waste of money, it costs big business money(err and why would you care?) and if someone gets scammed or buys a product that doesnt work as advertised - its their fault.

3. intellectual falsehoods: vaccines cause autism, climate change denial, fat is fine and proud - there is a very real thing as ""too much freedom"". You wouldn't let children smoke, you shouldn't tell someone who is morbidly obese that they are beautiful and healthy. they're not. humans are genetically hardwired to find unfit mates repulsive and unfit to pass on the genes. also you won't live pass 40.",mreddit11,1512432144,AskReddit

"Connie Maheswaran from Steven Universe.

I'll be honest, I didn't have much going into this besides ""She's the cutest but still cool"", but seeing everyone else having actual reasons means I have to as well.

So, let's get this first part out of the way: she's cute. Look at her design over the course of the show; she has a lot of alternates but still manages to tie with herself for the cutest biped in the show in every one of them. Also, little details in animation help, like hair physics, facial expressions, etc..

But more important is her character: she's shown to be a great learner, with a passion for it, almost like the subject doesn't matter as much as the next accomplishment. Sure, she is pressured into it by her parents to a degree, but the fact she still goes out of her way to learn shows they probably used a lot of positive reinforcement and now it's a part of who she is (Mr. and Dr. just needed to cool it down some, ya know?). It's kids like that who go on to do amazing things, but the best part is they can do anything. President, scientist, musician, defender of earth. All those jobs individually are just too easy for her to achieve. Maybe she'll mix and match them just to keep things interesting, who knows? President Dr. Maheswaran on the violin, and also she fights aliens on weekends. What up.",ZodiacWalrus,1512432144,AskReddit

"**THIS.**

I'm still in regular contact with two close friends from school. One of them has been through hell and back after her father died, she experienced depression so severe that it led to a suicide attempt and subsequently being sectioned, and her mother rejecting her for a long, long time after she came out as gay. But she is the kindest, most supportive friend I have and I can't imagine what my life would look like without her.

My other friend has turned into a narcissistic *arsehole* who only ever complains about her life, or her boyfriend's life, never accepts advice or help, and never so much as asks ""anyway, how are you?"". Recently she had an affair with a married man who had children, got together with her current boyfriend under similar circumstances, and constantly makes negative comments about other people's weight or general appearance. She blames all of this on depression. I struggle to understand this because - don't get me wrong, I've had my share of both physical and mental health struggles - depression is a horrible, horrible thing. I wouldn't wish it upon anyone. But it's **never** an excuse to be a shitty human being.

I'm holding the second one at arms length for now and letting the relationship slowly drift, because it's becoming toxic and detrimental to my own mental health. But it's painful, and to be honest, I kind of want my old friend back.",iwalkthedinosaur,1512432156,AskReddit

And since each book is based on Harry's year at school, it's probably easiest to go 1st Year=1991, 2nd Year=1992 etc.",LittlestSlipper55,1512432222,AskReddit
"""Having more money has diminishing utility as your wages go up. Do what you're passionate about and you'll never regret going to work.""

That's the equivalent of saying that learning about history (or any subject) has diminishing returns because you'll end up finding new angles to already resolved issues. What if Sir Isaac Newton spent his holiday drawing apples instead of developing mathematical tools to simply solve algebraic problems already solvable with algebra? We'd never have calculus and we'd still be trying to figure out aero-flight let alone space-flight.

It's called economies of scale, and you just have to think bigger. Do you think Bill Gates or Warren Buffet claim to have enough money to be fully satisfied? Not while there's still diseases ending lives early and socioeconomic hazards that prevent people living to their potential. If you're passionate about cars, having more money means opening your own shop; and then opening a chain of shops; and then having a brand that spans nationally. If you're passionate about charity, it mean helping a family instead of just one stranger; and then funding a shelter for a whole community; and then ending poverty as we know it today.",paldinws,1512432223,AskReddit

"&gt; If it is true that the Chinese and Russian detection systems are less advanced than the US then it stands to reason they have even less time to make a call than the US president would. 

The US could detect an ICBM almost immediately after the missile cleared the silo 30 years ago. Furthermore, a missile from the US to Russia (which is closer) has a flight time of about 20 minutes, not a ""couple of minutes"", longer toward China. Even then, both powers would quickly know based on the trajectory of the missile, and the small amount launched, that they were not being targeted.

You act like the people in the strategic services are incompetent. 

&gt; why would the US use a sub-launched missile against NK?

Because SLBMs offer the ability to suddenly and immediately strike a target, whereas an ICBM has upwards of 30 minutes of flight time to counter attack. Duh?

&gt; Chinese and Russian doctrine is secretive

Um, what? Based on what information? Almost all Russian doctrine was declassified at the end of the Cold War. 

&gt; o if there's no reason to use an SLBM, then it is somewhat reasonable to suppose that if the missile is sub-launched, then maybe it's not aimed at NK. 

Dude, you clearly don't seem to know much about nuclear weapons. Enough with the harebrained speculation. 1. The US has no reason to suddenly and immediately attack China, and China knows this. 2. It would blatantly be obvious if we were attacking them, there would not be ""confusion"" to take advantage of.

They loved that shit over there. I dunno if it's because they couldn't get with women their own age or just because they were sick pieces of shit, though.

I definitely think it's possible for people to start going after children because they can't get adults or for it to be conflated (ie, the reason they cannot get an adult relationship relates to the reason they go after children: lack of empathy, lack of social skills, mentally stuck at age 12, etc).

I definitely feel like a person can develop those tastes just by not properly participating in society and not learning empathy. I don't think it's necessarily something you are born with like a sexual orientation. In some people it may be, but not in everyone.

About priests I agree with you last time I googled it for 10 minutes I didn't see anything to say they are more likely to abuse children than non-priests.

These decisions are taken entirely in this country, they have nothing to do with the treaty. *As far as the treaty is concerned there are lots of options.

"

&gt;""In France and Germany, gifts are exchanged on Christmas Eve, while in Holland the children receive presents on December 5, in celebration of Saint Nicholas Day. It sounded sort of quaint until I spoke to a man named Oscar, who filled me in on a few of the details as we walked from my hotel to the Amsterdam train station.

&gt;Unlike the jolly, obese American Santa, Saint Nicholas is painfully thin and dresses not unlike the pope, topping his robes with a tall hat resembling an embroidered tea cozy. The outfit, I was told, is a carryover from his former career, when he served as a bishop in Turkey.

&gt;One doesn't want to be too much of a cultural chauvinist, but this seemed completely wrong to me. For starters, Santa didn't use to do anything. He's not retired, and, more important, he has nothing to do with Turkey. The climate's all wrong, and people wouldn't appreciate him. When asked how he got from Turkey to the North Pole, Oscar told me with complete conviction that Saint Nicholas currently resides in Spain, which again is simply not true. While he could probably live wherever he wanted, Santa chose the North Pole specifically because it is harsh and isolated. No one can spy on him, and he doesn't have to worry about people coming to the door. Anyone can come to the door in Spain, and in that outfit, he'd most certainly be recognized. On top of that, aside from a few pleasantries, Santa doesn't speak Spanish. He knows enough to get by, but he's not fluent, and he certainly doesn't eat tapas.

&gt;While our Santa flies on a sled, Saint Nicholas arrives by boat and then transfers to a white horse. The event is televised, and great crowds gather at the waterfront to greet him. I'm not sure if there's a set date, but he generally docks in late November and spends a few weeks hanging out and asking people what they want.

&gt;""Is it just him alone?"" I asked. ""Or does he come with backup?""

&gt;Oscar's English was close to perfect, but he seemed thrown by a term normally reserved for police reinforcement.

&gt;""Helpers,"" I said. ""Does he have any elves?""

&gt;Maybe I'm just overly sensitive, but I couldn't help but feel personally insulted when Oscar denounced the very idea as grotesque and unrealistic. ""Elves,"" he said. ""They're just so silly.""

&gt;The words silly and unrealistic were redefined when I learned that Saint Nicholas travels with what was consistently described as ""six to eight black men."" I asked several Dutch people to narrow it down, but none of them could give me an exact number. It was always ""six to eight,"" which seems strange, seeing as they've had hundreds of years to get a decent count.

&gt;The six to eight black men were characterized as personal slaves until the mid-fifties, when the political climate changed and it was decided that instead of being slaves they were just good friends. I think history has proven that something usually comes between slavery and friendship, a period of time marked not by cookies and quiet times beside the fire but by bloodshed and mutual hostility. They have such violence in Holland, but rather than duking it out among themselves, Santa and his former slaves decided to take it out on the public. In the early years, if a child was naughty, Saint Nicholas and the six to eight black men would beat him with what Oscar described as ""the small branch of a tree.""

&gt;""A switch?""

&gt;""Yes,"" he said. ""That's it. They'd kick him and beat him with a switch. Then, if the youngster was really bad, they'd put him in a sack and take him back to Spain.""

&gt;""Saint Nicholas would kick you?""

&gt;""Well, not anymore,"" Oscar said. ""Now he just pretends to kick you.""

&gt;""And the six to eight black men?""

&gt;""Them, too.""

&gt;He considered this to be progressive, but in a way I think it's almost more perverse than the original punishment. ""I'm going to hurt you, but not really."" How many times have we fallen for that line? The fake slap invariably makes contact, adding the elements of shock and betrayal to what had previously been plain, old- fashioned fear. What kind of Santa spends his time pretending to kick people before stuffing them into a canvas sack? Then, of course, you've got the six to eight former slaves who could potentially go off at any moment. This, I think, is the greatest difference between us and the Dutch. While a certain segment of our population might be perfectly happy with the arrangement, if you told the average white American that six to eight nameless black men would be sneaking into his house in the middle of the night, he would barricade the doors and arm himself with whatever he could get his hands on.

&gt;""Six to eight, did you say?""

&gt;In the years before central heating, Dutch children would leave their shoes by the fireplace, the promise being that unless they planned to beat you, kick you, or stuff you into a sack, Saint Nicholas and the six to eight black men would fill your clogs with presents. Aside from the threats of violence and kidnapping, it's not much different from hanging your stockings from the mantel. Now that so few people have a working fireplace, Dutch children are instructed to leave their shoes beside the radiator, furnace, or space heater. Saint Nicholas and the six to eight black men arrive on horses, which jump from the yard onto the roof. At this point, I guess, they either jump back down and use the door, or they stay put and vaporize through the pipes and electrical wires. Oscar wasn't too clear about the particulars, but, really, who can blame him? We have the same problem with our Santa. He's supposed to use the chimney, but if you don't have one, he still manages to come through. It's best not to think about it too hard.

&gt;While eight flying reindeer are a hard pill to swallow, our Christmas story remains relatively simple. Santa lives with his wife in a remote polar village and spends one night a year traveling around the world. If you're bad, he leaves you coal. If you're good and live in America, he'll give you just about anything you want. We tell our children to be good and send them off to bed, where they lie awake, anticipating their great bounty. A Dutch parent has a decidedly hairier story to relate, telling his children, ""Listen, you might want to pack a few of your things together before you go to bed. The former bishop from Turkey will be coming along with six to eight black men. They might put some candy in your shoes, they might stuff you in a sack and take you to Spain, or they might just pretend to kick you. We don't know for sure, but we want you to be prepared.""

&gt;This is the reward for living in Holland. As a child you get to hear this story, and as an adult you get to turn around and repeat it. As an added bonus, the government has thrown in legalized drugs and prostitution—so what's not to love about being Dutch?

&gt;Oscar finished his story just as we arrived at the station. He was a polite and interesting guy—very good company—but when he offered to wait until my train arrived, I begged off, saying I had some calls to make. Sitting alone in the vast terminal, surrounded by other polite, seemingly interesting Dutch people, I couldn't help but feel second-rate. Yes, it was a small country, but it had six to eight black men and a really good bedtime story. Being a fairly competitive person, I felt jealous, then bitter, and was edging toward hostile when I remembered the blind hunter tramping off into the Michigan forest. He might bag a deer, or he might happily shoot his sighted companion in the stomach. He may find his way back to the car, or he may wander around for a week or two before stumbling through your front door. We don't know for sure, but in pinning that license to his chest, he inspires the sort of narrative that ultimately makes me proud to be an American.""

Question from [+whitejaguar:](https://reddit.com/u/whitejaguar:)

Hello Mr Strømnes, you are very punctual. Thanks for doing this AMA and also on your cooperation in producing the comparative documentary on penitentiary systems.

My questions rather simple ones; what criticism do you face nationally and internationally about providing this kind of facilities and treatment to convicts/criminals. Do you get to hear a lot stuff what you doing is waste of tax-payer money or just lock them up, throw the key away. And if you collected such data; from which countries do you get the most positive and negative feedback.
And do join Fyodor Dostoevsky on the following remark: ""The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.""?",Concise_AMA_Bot,1512432142,ConciseIAmA
"[+jan_stromnes](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7hb4q6/iama_deputy_warden_of_the_worlds_most_humane/dqpkkl6/):

Not much critisism anymore, actually - only some in the beginning. The values, methods, et.c - are the same nationwide, so the reactions initally in Norway was that the facilities was ""to nice"". Same from some European countries, UK in particular. Later, the interest har been more curious and openminded - from most countries really, I guess it is because they feel we to something right.",Concise_AMA_Bot,1512432143,ConciseIAmA

Thank you for doing this AMA - I loved the documentary on Halden Prison that you made recently.

My questions are

1. How resource-intensive is Halden compared to say a prison in the US? From looking at the documentary it seems as if there is much less security required in Halden.

2. How does Halden compare on a cost-per-inmate basis compared to the US?

3. When will you have datasets available looking at the rates of recidivism for Halden inmates?

4. What is the post-release supervision like in Norway? Do you have a ‘probation and parole’ equivalent, to help inmates re-integrate into society?

5. You’ve mentioned the large % of inmates with mental health issues. Do you have a team of psychologists/psychiatrists to assist these inmates? What are the most common mental health issues you come across?

6. What drugs are most prevalent in Norway?

7. Does Norway have privately-run prisons such as in the US, or are they all state-run?

8. Since your visit to prisons in the US, have any of them expressed an interest in trialling a Halden-type model?

Thank you!",Concise_AMA_Bot,1512432237,ConciseIAmA

1. I don't have to much figures, but Halden (and Norway) definately have a better staff-inmate ratio. So the yearly operational cost is higher, but gives savings in the lang term. I don't think we have less Security, but we have different types of Security.
2. Don't know the US figures. Halden figures is given in an earlier question.  
3. New Reseach is being planned in Norway these days, but the directorate of  correctional service has decided that only national figures will be publicated, noe results for the individual facilities, unfortunately.
4. Yes we have.
5. Yes. In Norway, we have an ""import model"", meaning that those supplying the services in the ""outside world"" also supply the services in prison. So in this case it means that the county hospital have a treatment team in the prison. The issues varies a lot, from light anxiety/depression to severe personality dissorders, to autism Spectre issues (like Aspergers), and so on.
6. My guess - Cannabis and Amfetamin.
7. All are state-run.
8. Yes, several states are actually ""importing"" learning from Norway from a US Criminal Justice Innovation Progamme that we are a partner in.

The prison facilities is built based on normal Norwegian standards, hence building a copy in a less-developed country would probably not be an issue. And have in mind that the facilities is not the most important, but the approach we have towards rehabilitation and how we treat people humanely and respectfully.

I have heard a hundred times that people would ""love to commit crimes if they could go to Halden prison"". Let me just mention that those inmates that we have coming from countries far away and less developed - they often find it very tough to be in Halden prison. Why? You never get visits from family, and if you don't speak a language that a CO understands (normally English or Norwegian) you will as a general rule be denied the possibility to call home. And you hardly can communicate with your fellow inmates, leaving you in practice very isolated.

1. Is there ever a need for solitary confinement? If so,  how often is it used and for how long?

2. What role do case managers play in your prison system?

3. What are some effective strategies for changing prisoner behaviors for the long term?

4. What do you find to be most effective in changing a prisoners antisocial beliefs?

5. How do you create a more humane culture among security staff? Is it training,  personalities,  or a mixture of both?

"Obviously it's bad in any Hunter deck we're used to seeing, but in the spell-based deck Hunter deck I think it's potentially quite good. *Yogg and Load* decks relied on getting a good turn out of their **Lock and Load** to refuel their resources. **Rhok'delar** does the same thing without needing to rely on chaining spells. It's expensive, but that might be okay since you're going to want to play this later in the game when you're running out of resources anyway, and because it's a weapon you'll at least be able to swing at a threat on the board.


There's also the small advantage that any weapon removal tech that your opponent is running will matter a lot less against *Spell Hunter* as **Rhok'delar**'s effect is a Battlecry. Obviously you'd still lose a four attack swing, but your opponent will have spent two, three or five mana that turn destroying your weapon while you have a handful of spells to try and gain or maintain your advantage.


Obviously if you roll six copies **Toxic Arrow** then this sucks, but then *Razakus* decks can suck if **Raza the Chained** and **Shadowreaper Anduin** are at the bottom of your deck.

"As developers, we're not afraid to nerf game elements that are too powerful and are harming Path of Exile. Unfortunately, patch notes are not the best way to communicate these nerfs, because their format and information density makes it hard to include sufficient explanation.

In today's manifesto, we have highlighted and explained most of the significant nerfs in 3.1.0. Of course, there are plenty of buffs in 3.1.0 as well, but we'll leave those as pleasant surprises in tomorrow's full patch notes.

Vaal Pact Keystone
Being able to leech instantly meant that many threats were completely mitigated by high-damage fast-hitting characters with minimal leech investment. Vaal Pact has been changed to no longer grant instant leech, but instead doubles your character's leech rate and maximum leech rate. This was one of the most heavily-requested nerfs in the history of Path of Exile.

The keystone is still powerful, but now really benefits from investment in leech.

Atziri's Acuity
Atziri's Acuity has been changed to instead grant Vaal Pact if you've performed a critical strike recently, giving it a slightly different use when compared with the Vaal Pact keystone. It now fills a different role to its previous one and acts as a way for you to avoid some of the downsides of the Vaal Pact Keystone

Mind over Matter
The mana bonuses granted by the passive skills behind this keystone have been reduced. The mana granted was very high, especially at lower levels. The keystone is currently at a power level where further mana investment is still worthwhile.

Vulnerability, Despair and Wither
Vulnerability is now a Strength gem, focused on Physical Damage, Bleed and Maim.

Despair is a new Intelligence gem that will replace existing copies of Vulnerability. It reduces Chaos Resistance, increases Damage over Time taken, and grants added Chaos Damage to hits against cursed enemies. (This gem isn't counted as one of the ten new ones in 3.1.0).

Wither now has a lower max stack limit (15, down from 20) and slightly lower damage taken effect per stack (6% per stack, down from 7%).

Wither increased Chaos Damage taken by enemies much more than was reasonable for an easily totemifiable non-damage skill. We've split some of its damage bonus off into the new Despair curse, taking this opportunity to realign Vulnerability as a Strength-based curse as was more appropriate for a physical-damage-improving effect. As mentioned previously, old copies of the Vulnerability gem will become Despair with the release of 3.1.0.

Witchfire Brew now applies Despair.

Dark Pact
Dark Pact cast using your life no longer has bonus radius, and the damage bonus has been reduced from 95% more damage with hits and ailments when using your life to 76% more damage.

Own-life-spending Dark Pact builds were dealing too much damage over too large an area, granting an already very defensive build very high clear speeds.

Barrage
Barrage no longer has the additional projectile enchantment available in the Merciless Labyrinth. The equivalent Endgame Labyrinth enchantment now grants +1 additional Barrage Projectile (down from +2). Existing helmet enchantments are unmodified.

The additional projectile made this skill and enchantment combination the superior choice for bow/wand users. We want to ensure that there are several viable options for these characters.
Doomfletch and Doomfletch's Prism
Doomfletch: Now adds 100% of Physical Damage as Damage of a random Element (down from 110%). It no longer has increased Critical Strike Chance, and instead has (12-16) to (20-24) added Physical Damage.

Doomfletch's Prism: Now adds 100% of Physical Damage as Damage of each Element (down from 110%). As Doomfletch has no Critical Strike Chance value now, none is inherited here.

Doomfletch's Prism was providing some of the highest damage numbers of any bow in the game, so has been reduced. It's likely still the best bow.

Queen of the Forest
Now has 200 to 240% increased Evasion Rating (down from 240 to 380%). The movement speed bonus this item can provide has been capped at 100% for all versions.

Changes to evasion basetypes in The Fall of Oriath both pushed the evasion rating of this item too high, and took the movement speed this item granted to an extreme. We never intended for a single item to be able to provide so much movement speed. Over time as more movement speed and evasion became available this item has become unreasonable. The movement speed players were attaining was not something that the game was designed to handle. This cap is unlikely to affect average use of this item.

Rise of the Phoenix
Maximum Fire Resistance granted has been reduced to 5% (from 8%). Life regeneration has been increased to 15 to 20 per second (from 6). New versions now also grant 40 to 60 Life (this cannot be divined).

This item granted too much maximum fire resistance, more than any other shield provided for any other maximum resistance type. This made it far too easy to max out fire resistance on a Righteous Fire character. Other bonuses on the item have been added or increased to have the item remain useful for other builds.

Experience changes for high-level characters
Each league, the race to 100 is over more quickly than the previous one, as players become more efficient and the experience available gets larger. We receive overwhelming feedback (including from top racers) that this process should be made longer. We're going to be careful though, and just adjust it a bit at a time. In 3.1.0, this takes the form of small additional experience penalties at levels 95-99 that have the following effect:

95 to 96: 6.5% more experience needed
96 to 97: 11.5% more experience needed
97 to 98: 18.7% more experience needed
98 to 99: 28.25% more experience needed
99 to 100: 40% more experience needed

"I'm fine with them being consumable, but make them unlockables. Then in the vault or some sort of shader kiosk, have a collection that shows you what shaders you've collected or not. Then you just go buy however many shaders you need in your collection and use them from there. No need for a whole shader tab in the inventory that way leaving potential room for other stuff.

Hell, make the shaders gave specific tiers, just like engrams, and make them difficult to earn. You want the exotic shader from the EDZ? Better go complete the Nightfall when the strike is Arms Dealer and do all of the challenges and beat it with 5 minutes left. Want the legendary EDZ shader? Go unlock all the gear from Devrim or maybe complete all of the adventures on the EDZ for the first time.

Then, to top all of this off, every piece of gear that you use a shader on will remember that you used it. You can switch to it for free at any time. This lets us keep individual pieces of armor shaded in the way we want, but without such harsh limitations. It gives you incentives to earn shaders like before, but also the flexibility of the current system. ",Requiem191,1512432057,DestinyTheGame

Its just with raiding in general i have always felt like there are players not as good as they think they are but then you could always manage it still but this raid that causes more issues then before. A player causes a wipe and its every players fault but his which eventually leads to rude comments and so on till a group falls apart.

A good example of this i helped a friend on a normal run yesterday and when we got to gauntlet i went over everything explained how when we all run we stick to our 2 teams still cup get 1,3,5 dog 2,4 yadda yadda. We get to that part and wipe, then we wipe again. 

One ""Pro"" Lfg player with 20+ normal felt that since its normal he could take a orb still anyway without alerting others or doing a callout on the 2nd just confusing players. When i advised him no we do teams of 3 only and its just better for when players want to try prestige he states "" no interest in prestige so im just gonna grab what i want still"". 

This raid is just way more communication and mechanic based you cant do that ""i do what i want"" crap or like getting to calus on prestige and costing wipes because you dont to get teleported , etc",fred112015,1512432178,DestinyTheGame

"3 to 14 is a big jump. 14 to 60 is bigger. Yes, I know there were in between frames for actions, but they were universal. They aren't in a 3D model.

My explanation holds up because the 1 universal transition frame at 20 fps won't look as bad compared to 3 actual transition frames at 60 fps if the interpolation isn't great which is what needs the polish here.

Of course I'm excited, but the criticisms are unfounded and misdirected.",Ashenspire,1512432004,NintendoSwitch

"Maybe someone can answer and help me out.

So each blade has 4 specials (I, II, III, and IV) and there's ALSO special elemental combo abilities? Are these entirely element based and non-character specific?

So if I understand correctly, in order to use an elemental combo you need to use a I special, then a II and then a III special in a specific elemental order? But it looks like the combo overrides the special so starting with the II it looks like you don't use the blade specific special, but the elemental combo ability?

So what's the point of having 4 blade unique specials? When would you want to use the elemental combos over just spamming normal specials or vice versa?

And then there's the IV specials which charge differently? It said they only charge when a driver is near their blade, but is it a different charging or just a continuation of normal special charge?",LysergicLark,1512432030,NintendoSwitch

He hasn't even been that bad in fantasy.

People overrate how good you have to be do be useful RB in fantasy.  In my Half-PPR.  Marshawn is the lowest RB2 with 9.95 points per game.  

I removed Weeks 1-3 from hunt (aka the big ones) and since he is averaging  10.1 ppg.  This would put him at RB23 over that stretch.  This is all while the Chiefs are shitting the bed.  I'm certainly worried, but dropping someone who is an RB2 is just retarded and this only happens in Taco leagues.

He's an RB3 *at worst* even if he only averages 8-10ppg the rest of the year.

I get why people are salty, I am too.  But dropping him is just dumb, and sounds like guy in OPs league is a giant taco or just doing it for attention to because of his salt.

RB3's even are a big commodity, so now we are dropping them because they started out the year so good and haven't lived up to it?

I don't think it is particulary strong, I tried it on many champions and it is usually not useless but there's no reason to take it over anything else.

this post, again, if you read it, is about champions who do NOT build a lot of resists or health. and those are being punished by the early game of poke and all in champions who simply have too much damage.

this means if you want to scale or survive early you'd have to go a defensive set up, but you can't because the defensive set up for early game is that bad.
